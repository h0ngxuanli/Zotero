ABSTRACT

KEYWORDS

With the growing success of graph neural networks (GNNs), the explainability of GNN is attracting considerable attention. Current explainers mostly leverage feature attribution and selection to explain a prediction. By tracing the importance of input features, they select the salient subgraph as the explanation. However, their explainability is at the granularity of input features only, and cannot reveal the usefulness of hidden neurons. This inherent limitation makes the explainers fail to scrutinize the model behavior thoroughly, resulting in unfaithful explanations.
In this work, we explore the explainability of GNNs at the granularity of both input features and hidden neurons. To this end, we propose an explainer-agnostic framework, Cooperative GNN Explanation (CGE) to generate the explanatory subgraph and subnetwork simultaneously, which jointly explain how the GNN model arrived at its prediction. Specifically, it first initializes the importance scores of input features and hidden neurons with masking networks. Then it iteratively retrains the importance scores, refining the salient subgraph and subnetwork by discarding low-scored features and neurons in each iteration. Through such cooperative learning, CGE not only generates faithful and concise explanations, but also exhibits how the salient information flows by activating and deactivating neurons. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, validating the superiority of CGE over state-of-the-art approaches like GNNExplainer and PGExplainer.

Explainability, Graph Neural Networks, Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
1 INTRODUCTION
Graph neural networks (GNNs) [7, 31] have achieved promising performance in a variety of domains, where graph-structured data are involved, such as biochemistry [18, 39], social networking [11, 16], and e-commerce [14, 41]. The success comes mainly from the powerful expressiveness of GNNs, which incorporates the graph structure into representation learning. However, it usually comes at the cost of model opacity — that is, GNNs work as a black box, making the decision-making process obscure and hard to interpret [23]. Hence, researchers raised the question of post-hoc explainability: “What knowledge does the GNN use to make a certain prediction?”.
Most prior studies [1, 15, 17, 32] realize post-hoc explainability from answering “Which fractions of input graph are most influential to the GNN’s prediction?”, thus generating explanations at the granularity of input features [3]. Scrutinizing the explainers proposed in these studies, we summarize the common scheme of feature attribution and selection. Specifically, given an input graph and its prediction, an explainer distributes the prediction to the input features, traces the importance of each feature, and selects the salient subgraph (e.g., a subset of edges with top importance) as the explanation of the input graph. For example, in the toxicity classification of molecule graph, some functional groups (e.g., cyano group) contain rich saliency information related to the model outcome and align well with human cognition. Such an explanatory subgraph can be viewed as the prototypical knowledge memorized by the GNN classifiers.
However, there are two intrinsic limitations in this scheme:
• The explainers focus solely on the explainability of input features, while leaving the explainability of hidden neurons (or units) [2, 38] unexplored. That is, they only highlight the contribution of each feature to the prediction, without probing into the role of each neuron in making the decision. Considering the GNN classifier that predicts a molecule graph as toxic, even if the explainer can latch on a cyano group as the explanatory subgraph to toxicity, it is unable to answer “Which fractions of classifier neurons are responsible for capturing the cyano group?”. Hence, limiting the explanations to input features fails to scrutinize the model behavior thoroughly.
• Most explainers suffer from the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue, which is caused by the distribution shift between original input graphs and explanatory subgraphs. As shown in recent works

• We propose a general framework, CGE, which integrates LTH and MMI to generate the explanatory subgraph and subnetwork simultaneously.
• Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of CGE over current explanation methods with better explainability.

2 PRELIMINARY AND RELATED WORK

[19, 25, 30], OOD makes the post-hoc explanations less faithful and reliable to reveal the decision-making process. Hence, these works instead incorporate the feature attribution and selection scheme into the GNN model, so as to make the model intrinsically interpretable [25]. However, such intrinsic interpretability poses hurdle to explainers from explaining the trained models.
In this work, we explore the explainability of GNN models at the granularity of both input features and model neurons, aiming to remedy the aforementioned limitations. To hit two birds with one stone, we propose a new scheme, Cooperative GNN Explanation (CGE), which incorporates the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) [8, 9] with the criterion of maximum mutual information (MMI) [3, 32]. Intuitively, LTH strives to specify a sparse subnetwork from the GNN via iterative pruning, which can be trained independently to maintain the original performance; meanwhile, MMI refines a subgraph from the original input, which maximizes the mutual information between the subgraph and the label.
Targeting on the integration of LTH and MMI, we systemize CGE as a combination of two components: subgraph detector and subnetwork detector. The subgraph detector can be instantiated with one of the current input-aware explainer (e.g., GNNExplainer [32], SA [1], PGExplainer [17], Gem [15], GSAT [19]), while the subnetwork detector can be implemented with the winning ticket [8, 9] of LTH. They play a cooperative game and update iteratively, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, in each pruning iteration, the subgraph detector first identifies a subgraph based on MMI. Then, the subgraph is fed into the target model to score the importance of neurons. Hereafter, inspired by LTH, the subnetwork detector discards the neurons with the lowest importance scores, and then selectively rewinds them to the initial states to get the winning ticket (i.e., the subnetwork). In view of interdependent and iterative training between two detectors, we exploit the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [5, 10, 21] to guarantee convergence. This iterative pruning leads to the cooperative explanations, which not only exhibits how salient information flows in the GNN model by activating neurons, but also helps delineate the class-aware semantics of neurons.
Our main contributions can be summarized as:
• We highlight the importance of cooperative explanation at the granularity of both input features and model neurons.

In this section, we first introduce the backgrounds of GNNs, and then present the conventional formulation and existing methods of GNN explainability w.r.t. input features.

2.1 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

Let G be a undirected input graph, which involves the node set V

and the edge set E. For node 𝑣𝑖 ∈ V, we denote its pre-existing

features by a 𝑑-dimensional attribute vector x𝑖 ∈ R𝑑 , and collect the features of all nodes into X ∈ R|V |×𝑑 . For the structural features

describing the graph topology, we define an adjacency matrix A ∈ R|V |×|V |, where 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1 if the edge connecting nodes 𝑣𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗

exists (i.e., (𝑣𝑖, 𝑣 𝑗 ) ∈ E), otherwise 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 0. In a nutshell, G can be

alternatively represented as G = (A, X).

Upon the input graph, graph neural networks (GNNs) [7, 13, 27]

are excellent at incorporating the graph structure into the represen-

tation learning by propagating and aggregating neural information

along with the structure. Benefiting from high-quality representa-

tions, GNN models have achieved remarkable success in various

tasks, including node classification [26, 40], graph classification

[4, 37], and link prediction [33, 34]. In this work, we focus on

the scenario of graph classification. Formally, we can systematize

the GNN model 𝑓 as a combination of two modules: the GNN

encoder 𝑓1 and the classifier 𝑓2, i.e., 𝑓 = 𝑓2 ◦ 𝑓1. Typically, the GNN encoder 𝑓1 : G → R𝑑′ generates the graph representation for the input graph G via three core stages: (1) recursively distill

the neural information from neighboring nodes (or edges), (2) ag-

gregate the information to update the representation of each ego node, and (3) garner all node representations as the 𝑑 ′-dimensional

representation of the holistic graph. Subsequently, the classifier

maps

into

the

contribution over 𝐶 classes. This process can be summarized as

𝑦 = 𝑓2 (𝑓1 (G)) = 𝑓 (G|Θ), where Θ is the set of model parameters

(i.e., neurons or units).

2.2 Post-hoc Explainability of GNNs
The scheme of feature attribution and selection [1, 17, 28, 29, 32] prevails towards post-hoc explanations of GNN models. It focuses on explainability w.r.t. input features, aiming to answer “Which fractions of input graph contribute most to the model prediction?”. Towards this end, it usually employs an additional explainer method to trace contributions of individual features, and then selects the salient part (e.g., a subset of nodes or edges with top contributions) as the explanatory subgraph G𝑠 . We formulate the input-aware explainer as 𝑠inp, which yields the explanatory subgraph G𝑠 , i.e., G𝑠 = 𝑠inp (G|Θ).
To obtain the subgraph that best supports the predictive label Y, a prevailing criterion of maximum mutual information (MMI) [3, 32] identifies the explanatory subgraph that solely maximizes the information amount about Y. More formally, MMI is presented

G𝑠

s.t. G𝑠 = 𝑠inp (G),

(1)

where 𝐼 (·, ·) measures the mutual information between two variables. Following previous studies [1, 17, 28], we focus on the structural features (i.e., the presence of an edge and its nodes), leaving the node features in future work.

Feature Attribution. The mainstream explainers to attribute the prediction to input features can be roughly categorized into three groups: gradient-, attnetion-, and perturbation-based research lines. Specifically, gradient-based line [1, 22] backpropagates gradients of the target prediction w.r.t. the input features. Such gradient-like signals are viewed as the approximations of feature importance. For example, SA [1] directly calculates the squared values of gradients to represent the importance scores of nodes. Perturbation-based line [15, 32, 36] studies the output variations in response to different input perturbations. This line is inspired by the intuition that the downstream predictions are likely to significantly change if sensitive features are perturbed. For example, GNNExplainer [32] adds soft masks to the input graph’s adjacency matrix and node features, and trains them by maximizing the mutual information between the masked outcome and target prediction. Attention-based line [17, 19, 29] focuses on training an attention function for edge attribution according to input features. For example, GSAT (in its post-hoc working mode) [19] trains a parameterized predictor to generate the stochastic attention for each edge in the input graph.
Feature Selection. In the process of feature selection, subgraph candidates are guided by diverse constraints (e.g., sparsity constraints, connective constraints, information bottleneck constraints). In more detail, sparsity constraints [28, 32] typically leverage the 𝑙1 norm to guarantee that the selected subgraph remains within a prescribed size. As the determinant subgraphs are expected to be connected, connective constraints [17, 36] are used to allocate more selective probabilities to the edges, which connect with the part selected already. More recently, information bottleneck constraints [19] are proposed to squeeze the mutual information between the selected subgraph and the input graph.

3 ANALYSIS ON POST-HOC EXPLAINABILITY
Aside the success of the post-hoc explainability, considerable attention has recently been paid to the inherent issues of this trajectory [19, 30]. In this section, we first reveal the fundamental limitations (i.e., OOD issue) of the post-hoc explainability; then we employ EM framework [5, 21] to derive a novel shortcut to reveal this limitation from the iterative optimization perspective. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of cooperative explainability and illustrate the advantages of the cooperative explainer.

3.1 Revealing the OOD Limitation

We first formalize the date distribution of target model as 𝑃 (G, Y). To approximate MI between G and Y, the target model 𝑓 (·|Θ) in function space: 𝑓 : G → R𝐶 is optimized via maximizing MI between 𝑓 (G|Θ) and Y:

Θ := arg max 𝐼 (𝑓 (G|𝜃 ); Y) ,

(2)

𝜃

Figure 2: Illustration of limitations of post-hoc explanation methods. Best viewed in color.

where (G, Y) is independent and identically distributed (IID) from
𝑃 (G, Y). Now consider the latent distribution of subgraphs with their labels formulated as 𝑃 (G𝑠, Y). Analogously, to approximate MI between G𝑠 and Y, 𝑓 (·|Θˆ ) is indispensable which conforms to:

Θˆ := arg max 𝐼 (𝑓 (G𝑠 |𝜃 ); Y) ,

(3)

𝜃

where (G𝑠, Y) is IID sampled from 𝑃 (G𝑠, Y).
As shown in recent works [19, 30], the distribution of full graphs
differs from that of subgraphs, which poses an out-of-distribution
(OOD) issue in the data space. Worse still, comparing Equations (2) and (3), we argue that OOD between 𝑃 (G, Y) and 𝑃 (G𝑠, Y) in the data space consequently leads to OOD between 𝑃 (𝑓 (·|Θ)) and 𝑃 (𝑓 (·|Θˆ )) in the function space, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, 𝐼 (𝑓 (G𝑠 |Θ); Y) is not strictly proportional to 𝐼 (G𝑠 ; Y). As a result, treating 𝑓 (·|Θ) as the proxy of 𝑓 (·|Θˆ ) is an inherent limitation of
post-hoc explainability. That is, unaware of this limitation, most previous explainers [17, 19, 29, 32] simply feed subgraph 𝑓 (·|Θ) into the original network Θ, rather than 𝑓 (·|Θˆ ), and then use 𝐼 (𝑓 (G𝑠 |Θ); Y)
as the main part of the loss function to optimize the explainer.

3.2 Remedying the OOD limitation
According to Equation (3), the learning of explanatory subgraph G𝑠 and the approximation of 𝑓 (·|Θˆ ) are mutually and interdependently promoted. Hence, the conventional one-shot training stops short for optimizing G𝑠 and Θˆ . To get around this dilemma, the existing explainers take 𝑓 (·|Θ) as the proxy of 𝑓 (·|Θˆ ), thereby suffering from the OOD limitation and making the explanations less faithful. In this work, we aim to confront the problem and employ the idea of Expectation-Maximization (EM) [5, 10, 21] to alleviate it. Generally, EM algorithm alternates between expectation step (E-step) and maximization step (M-step):
• E-step: Estimate parameters from observed data and existing models, then use this estimated parameter value to calculate the conditional probability expectation.
• M-step: Find the corresponding parameter via maximizing the likelihood function.
We then concrete these two steps to remedy the OOD limitation of post-hoc explainability. Concisely, in E-step, we fix the parameters 𝜃 and extract subgraph G𝑠 ; in M-step, we fix the subgraph G𝑠 and optimize the parameters 𝜃 . These two phases can be formulated as following, where 𝑡 is the epoch of training:

By alternating between these two phases, we can explanatory subgraph G𝑠 and target function 𝑓 (·|Θˆ ) can be gained in a finite number
of iterations.

3.3 Advantages of Cooperative Explainability
Besides the distribution shifts in function space, limiting the explanations to input features solely is another issue of the current post-hoc explainers. Distinct from prior studies, cooperative explainability performs explanation on both subgraph and subnetwork. Scrutinizing “Which fractions of input features and model neurons are most influential to the target prediction?” allows us to interpret the input-neuron relationships during the decisionmaking process. Moreover, different groups of neurons might be activated for different explanatory subgraphs, especially in distinct predictive classes, thus working as experts [2, 38] to latch on the class-wise knowledge. Finding such meaningful abstractions (i.e., the pair of subgraph and subnetwork) is one of the main goals of explainability.
Cooperative explainability can also boost the accuracy of posthoc explainers. Since explanation methods focus on interpreting a certain graph merely, generating explanation on the full network inevitably extracts various class-wise features, which introduces noise into explanations (See Figure 3). As cooperative explainability is able to outscore the salient neurons that focus on the certain class-wise pattern, it strongly squeezes the tightness of input edges and model neurons and shields the negative influence from the irrelevant or redundant neurons. In conclusion, cooperative explainability can not only endow the post-hoc explainers with better

concreted via combining MMI and LTH (Section 4.2 and Section 4.3). Moreover, we show how the CGE exhibits information flow through the model in Section 4.4.

4.1 A Tractable Objective for EM framework

Following Section 3, Our CGE aims to: (1) search explanatory subgraph G𝑠 and latent function 𝑓 (·|Θˆ ) to remedy the OOD limitation and (2) extract explanatory subnetwork to erasure the noisy features in explanations. To kill two birds with one stone and accelerate convergence, CGE constraints the initial states and searching domain of 𝑓 (·|Θˆ ) to the original network 𝑓 (·|Θ) and the set of subnetwork of 𝑓 (·|Θ). CGE then employs two cooperative players to implement E-step and M-step alternately: (1) the subgraph detector 𝑠1, which functions similarly to the feature-aware explainer (cf. Equation (1)) and extracts the sparse but critical subgraph from the full input graph; and (2) the subnetwork detector 𝑠2, which captures the crucial neurons activated by the explanatory subgraph. These two detectors have the shared goal of recovering the target prediction, so as to exhibit the input-neuron-output relationships inherent in the model, as shown in Figure 1.
Since the conditional probability expectation in Equation (2) and Equation (3) is intractable, cooperative MMI is introduced to make the computation traversing from probability estimation to mutual information. More specially, we formulate cooperative MMI as:

max 𝐼 (Y; G𝑠, Θ𝑠 ) = 𝐻 (Y) − 𝐻 (Y|G𝑠, Θ𝑠 ),
G𝑠 ,Θ𝑠

s.t. G𝑠 = 𝑠1 (G), Θ𝑠 = 𝑠2 (Θ),

(6)

where Θ𝑠 is the parameters of explanatory subnetwork that takes the explanatory subgraph G𝑠 as the input and yields the prediction 𝑓 (G𝑠 |Θ𝑠 ); 𝐻 (Y|G, Θ𝑠 ) is the cross entropy between the recovered

prediction 𝑓 (G𝑠 |Θ𝑠 ) and the label Y. Both subgraph and subnetwork detectors are forced to select the edge set and neuron set with predefined sizes or sparsity levels. When observing the explanatory subgraph, the subnetwork detector decides which neurons will be activated or deactivated to maintain the target prediction.
These detectors essentially indicate contributions to the input edges and model neurons. Hence, it seeks to find two masks, M1 and M2, and frames Equation (6) as:

max 𝐼 (Y; M1 ⊙ A, M2 ⊙ Θ),

(7)

M1,M2

where M1 and M2 are the masks with the sparsity constraint, which have identical shapes to the adjacency matrix A and the parameter set Θ, respectively; ⊙ is the element-wise product.
Cooperative MMI criterion can identify the explanatory subgraph and subnetwork that collaborates together and maximizes the predictive performance. In this case, we reframe E-step (i.e., subgraph detector) and M-step (i.e., subnetwork detector) as:

E-step: Given estimated function 𝑓 (·|𝜃 (𝑡) ) and label Y, extracting explanatory subgraph G𝑠(𝑡) via maximizing the mutual information
between output and Y:

G𝑠(𝑡) := arg max 𝐼 (𝑓 (G𝑠 | 𝜃 (𝑡) ); Y).

(8)

G𝑠

training the subnetwork can achieve the matching performance to the dense model. Coincidentally, this idea is consistent with our aim for explanatory subnetwork. Hence, we incorporate LTH with MMI to implement subnetwork detector (cf. Equation 9), which consists of three key steps during one iteration: (1) distinguishable initialization of masks, (2) iterative selection of neurons, and (3) selective rewinding. We next elaborate these steps one by one.
4.3.1 Distinguishable Initialization. To learn the masks M2, a straightforward solution is to randomly initialize them and optimize them via Equation (7). To understand the role of neurons, we go beyond the random initialization of M2 and leverage the magnitudes of neurons to guide the optimization of M2. Intuitively, larger magnitudes indicate that the neurons are more crucial during making decisions, and vice versa. This distinguished initialization at the beginning of each iteration is able to accelerate the convergence of optimization and improve the identification of salient subnetwork. Formally, we summarize it as:
M2(0) = R + 𝜎 (Θ/Θ¯ ), M2(𝑡) = M2(𝑡−1) (R + 𝜎 (Θ/Θ¯ )), (11)
where R is the randomly initialized scores; 𝑡 is the cycle of iteration; 𝜎 is the sigmoid function that maps the scores to [0, 1]; Θ represents the magnitudes of neurons, with Θ¯ as its median magnitude.

M-step: Taking subgraph G𝑠(𝑡) as input to extract explanatory subnetwork 𝑓 (·|𝜃 (𝑡+1) ) via maximizing the mutual information
between output and Y:

𝜃 (𝑡+1) := arg max 𝐼 (𝑓 (G𝑠(𝑡) | 𝜃 ); Y).

(9)

𝜃

Note that according to the properties of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Jensen’s inequality, EM algorithm is proved to be deterministically convergent [5, 21]. Similarly, while merging MLE and Jensen’s inequality into information theory, CGE can be proved to be convergent in a finite number of iterations.

4.2 Implementation of Subgraph Detector

To extract the subgraph following Equation (8), CGE generalizes

current feature-aware explainers ℎ to the subgraph detector. Given graph G𝑠 and network 𝑓 (·|Θ𝑠 ), explainer ℎ first attributes the prediction 𝑓 (G𝑠 |Θ𝑠 ) to the features in G𝑠 to extract an explanatory
subgraph; then ℎ yields the mask M1 according to the explanatory subgraph. Specially, for the edges selected by the explainers ℎ, we

set their masks in M1 to 1; for the edges unselected, we set their masks in M1 to 0. We formulate this procedure as:

M1(𝑡) = ℎ(M1(𝑡−1) ⊙ A, 𝑓 (· | M2(𝑡) ⊙ Θ)),

(10)

where 𝑡 is the cycle of iteration. Note that this procedure is explainer-

agnostic, namely we can subsume arbitrary explainers under sub-

graph detector in CGE.

4.3 Implementation of Subnetwork Detector
Although studies [17, 28, 32] have been extensively conducted on identifying the salient subgraph, network dissection of GNNs remains largely unexplored. To this end, we exploit the idea of LTH [8]. Specifically, LTH strives to specify a highly-spare subnetwork from the dense model via iterative pruning, such that independently

4.3.2 Iterative Selection. Having established the modeling of neuron importance, we now optimize M2. Specifically, our goal is to narrow the gap between the target prediction and the prediction upon the cooperative explanations. As such, we reframe Equation (7) as minimizing the following objective function:
LCGE = 𝑙 (Y, 𝑓 (M1(𝑡) ⊙ A | M2(𝑡) ⊙ Θ)) + 𝛾 ||M2(𝑡) ||1, (12)
where 𝑙 measures the prediction gap; 𝛾 is the hyperparameter to control the 𝑙1 sparsity of M2. In each iteration, subnetwork detector first receives M1 from subgraph detector and distinguished initialize M2. When the training stage of M2 is over, we can rank all neurons based on M2, and then select the crucial neurons with top importance scores. To be more specific, neurons with large scores are garnered to separately compose subnetwork 𝑓 (·|Θ𝑠 ), while the rest are not invited to take part in the following procedures.
4.3.3 Selective Rewinding. At the end of each iteration, we rewind the importance scores of neurons and transform M2(𝑡) to a binarization matrix as following: • For the selected neurons, we rewind their masks in M2(𝑡) to 1; • For the unselected neurons, we isolate them from the following
procedures and rewind their masks to 0.
CGE alternates between the phase of two detectors until the selection ratio reaches the prescribed threshold. The inessential correlations between edges and neurons are gradually eliminated during these iterations. After training, the final selections are considered as the most significant parts which contribute most to the target prediction. The achievement of CGE can be summarized as: (1) explanatory subgraph G𝑠 extracted by CGE contains the set of most label-relevant features and few noisy features; (2) explanatory subnetwork 𝑓 (·|Θ𝑠 ) extracted by CGE can not only delineate the class-aware semantics of neurons, but also be the optimal approximation of latent function 𝑓 (·|Θˆ ). In conclusion, CGE can unleash

the full potential of post-hoc explainers by remedying their inherent limitations and achieve cooperative explanation simultaneously.
4.4 Exhibiting Information Flow via CGE
Besides the boosting accuracy of post-hoc explainers and achieving cooperative explanations, CGE can also exhibit how the salient subgraph is passed forward by activating and deactivating neurons. Specially, through inspection on the cooperative explanations (i.e., the pair of explanatory subgraph and subnetwork), we observe that such abstractions somehow delineate the class-aware semantics:
• Difference among different classes. For input graphs belonging to different classes, a tiny ratio (about 30%) of neurons are activated simultaneously in their explanatory subnetworks. That is, the model parameters can be split into multiple experts [2, 38], each of which holds a class-wise view.
• Consistency within identical classes. A couple of input graphs from the same class activate a high ratio (more than 80%) of neurons simultaneously, indicating that the class-aware prototypical patterns are carried by similar explanatory subgraphs and memorized by shared subnetworks.
We present such neurons as the class-aware information flow. Formally, for class 𝑐, we first build a subset D𝑐 to collect graphs labeled with 𝑐, and hire CGE to generate the cooperative subgraph and subnetwork per graph. Then we set an enumerator T, which has the identical shapes to Θ, to traverse the subnetworks collectively and count the activated frequency of each neuron. Frequently activated neurons explicitly show how the class-specific information flows in the model and arrives at the target prediction.
5 EXPERIMENT
We present empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CGE. The experiments aim to investigate the following research questions:
• RQ1: Can CGE boost the performance of existing methods when explainability is focused on input features solely?
• RQ2: How does the CGE perform while input features and model neurons are explained simultaneously?
• RQ3: Can CGE exhibit the information flow and delineate the class-aware semantics of neurons?
5.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets and Target GNNs. To evaluate the effectiveness of CGE, we adopt three benchmark datasets: BA3-motif [32], Mutagenicity [12], and MNIST [6], which are publicly accessible and vary in terms of domain, size, and sparsity. Three popular GNN models are trained to perform graph classification. Table 1 summarizes the statistics of datasets and the configurations of GNN models.

• Molecule graph classification. We consider a real-world dataset, Mutagenicity [12, 24], where 4,337 molecule graphs are categorized into two classes based on their mutagenic effect on the Gram-negative bacterium.
• Handwriting graph classification. We use the MNIST superpixel dataset [20], which contains 70,000 graphs labeled as one of ten digit classes. In this dataset, the original MNIST images [6] are converted to graphs using super-pixels, which represent small regions of homogeneous intensity in images.

Evaluation Metrics. It is challenging to quantitatively evaluate the quality of explanations since human evaluations are highly dependent on their subjective understanding. Prior studies have proposed some metrics to quantitatively assess the explanations[7, 35], we select the following metrics:

• Predictive Accuracy (ACC@𝑝) [3]. This metric measures the performance of the explanatory subgraphs by feeding it solely into the target model and auditing how well it recovers the target prediction. Where, 𝑝 is the selection ratio; 𝑝 · ∥A∥0 is the size of explanatory subgraph and 𝑝 · ∥Θ∥0 is the size of explanatory subnetwork. We report the ACC-AUC as the area under the ACC curve over different selection ratios.
• Precision@𝑁 [32]. This metric measures the consistency between the explanatory subgraph and ground-truths subgraph. Specifically, the edges within the ground-truth subgraph are positive in an explanatory subgraph, while the remains are negative. In this case, precision can be adopted as the evaluation protocol. More formally:

Precision@𝑁 = EG

|G𝑠 G∗ | |G∗ |

(13)

where G𝑠 is composed of the top-𝑁 edges and G∗ is the groundtruth subgraph.

• Fidelity@𝑝 [35]. The Fidelity metric studies the prediction change

by removing important input features identified by explanation

methods. Formally, fidelity can be defined as:

Fidelity @𝑝 = EG 𝑓 (G)𝑦 − 𝑓 (G − G𝑠 )𝑦

(14)

where 𝑦 is the original prediction of G; G𝑠 is composed of the
top 𝑝 · ∥A∥0 edges; G − G𝑠 is the subgraph created by removing G𝑠 from G.

• Motif graph classification. We construct a synthetic dataset: BA-3motifs which contains 3,000 graphs. Following previous works [17, 32], we adopt the Barabasi-Albert (BA) graphs as the base and attach each graph with one of three motif types: house, cycle, and grid.

Alternative Baseline Approaches. To evaluate the quality of explanatory subgraphs, we compare our method with the stateof-the-art methods, covering the gradient-based methods (SA [1]), perturbation-based methods (GNNExplainer [32], Gem [15], SubgraphX [36]) and attention-based methods (PGExplainer [17], GSAT

in its post-hoc working mode[19]). Note that since IB regularization used in GSAT can not beforehand assign the certain sparsity tailored for numbers of iterations, for fair comparison, we employ 𝑙1 sparsity to replace it in experiments.
5.2 Evaluation of Explanatory Subgraph (RQ1)
Qualitative evaluation. Table 2 shows the accuracy, fidelity and precision of different post-hoc explanation methods. For simplicity, the baseline explainers enhanced by CGE are named as “explainers + CGE”. According to Table 2 we find that:

EM framework: (1) LTH allows CGE to filter the irrelevant and redundant information in model neurons by iteratively selecting and rewinding, which baseline explainers can not distinguish. (2) EM framework alternately propels meticulous selection to remedy the OOD limitation, which forces CGE to focus on the latent important features and leave obviously inessential features out in the early training stage. • Compared with the performance in BA3-motif and Mutagenicity, CGE consistently performs better in MNIST across diverse metrics and baseline explainers. These improvements verify the theoretical analysis in Section 3.3. Specially, since cooperative explainability is able to outscore the salient neurons that focus on the certain class-wise pattern, CGE can shield the negative influence from the irrelevant or redundant neurons. As the consequence, CGE can achieve more significant enhancements while the number of classes in dataset D is large. • CGE provides much stabler explanation than the baselines as for the much smaller variance. More specially, STD of CGE outperforms baseline by a larger margin (24.5% ↓) on average. This phenomenon verifies that CGE can remedy the limitations of over-reliance on the quality of the target model.
Qualitative evaluation. We randomly choose the graph instances from class house, cycle, and grid in the synthetic BA3-motif dataset and present visual inspections of their explanatory subgraphs given by different explainers in Figure 4. For each explainer, we highlight the edges which have the top-𝐾 importance scores by red lines, where 𝐾=6. The ground-truth nodes are highlighted in green, while the turbulence nodes w.r.t. nodes in BA-motif are distinguished in blue. According to Figure 4 we can observe that:

• The current explainers enhanced by CGE outperform themselves in all cases. To be more specific, CGE achieves significant improvements over the strongest baselines w.r.t. fidelity by 6.8% and 7.2% in MNIST and BA3-motif, respectively. It demonstrates the effectiveness and universality of CGE, and verifies that CGE can be leveraged to boost the accuracy of post-hoc explainers. We attribute these improvements to the implementation of LTH and

• The important edges selected by the CGE framework largely conform to the ground-truth of their graphs, which might result from the class-wise patterns captured by the explanatory subnetwork. On the other hand, some edges not belonging to the ground-truth are selected by the baseline explainers.
• Compared with subgraphs selected by baseline explainers, subgraphs generated by CGE have better connectivity. We attribute

these differences to the alternately and iterative selecting, which baseline explainers can not carry out. • For blue nodes in BA motif, some nodes connecting to the green nodes might cause interference to the procedure of generating explanations. Our CGE can avoid these traps, while the subgraphs generated by baseline methods contain these turbulence nodes. This demonstrates the robustness and the reliability of the CGE.

redundant mutual information between model neurons and target predictions, and generates faithful and concise cooperative explanations. • Similar to the task in Section 5.2 w.r.t explainability of input features solely, CGE achieves more significant improvements while the number of classes in dataset D is large. This phenomenon further verifies the theoretical analysis in Section 3.3.
5.4 Exhibition of Information Flow (RQ3)

5.3 Evaluation of Cooperative Explanation (RQ2)
We now focus on the explanations provided by CGE, and qualitative evaluation whether the CGE performs while input feature and model neurons are explained simultaneously. For fair comparison, we employ baseline explainers and the scheme of LTH to achieve one-shot explanations at the granularity of input features and neurons. The average ACC-AUC in different network sparsity are presented in Table 3. We find that:
• The subgraphs and subnetworks generated by the framework of CGE get the highest accuracy on the original graph classification task. Specifically, CGE achieves significant improvements over the strongest baselines w.r.t. ACC-AUC by 9.7% and 11.4% in Mutagenicity and MNIST, respectively. These improvements verify the reliability and effectiveness of the CGE. Since all baseline explainers employ the form of cooperative explanation and the LTH, we contribute these improvements mainly to the advantages of alternately extraction. Specifically, by leveraging alternative extraction, CGE iteratively filters the irrelevant and

We now focus on the class-specific information flow generated by CGE according to Section 4.4. Taking BA3-motif as an example, each layer in the relevant model w.r.t ASAP is divided into four parts according to explanatory subnetworks. The visual inspection of information flow is exhibited in Figure 5, where the numbers in network represent the ratios of neurons which class-wise inputs flow through to all neurons. To verify the fidelity and the robustness of information flow, we feed the class-specific subset D𝑐 into the relevant neurons (i.e., class-specific information flow) and show the predictive accuracy in Figure 5.
We can find that for each class in BA3-motif, the accuracy of relevant information flow is not less than 84%. While the information flow is exhibited, CGE explicitly shows how the class-specific information put forward in the model by activating different neurons. Meanwhile, these abstractions also somehow delineate the class-aware semantics of neurons.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explored the cooperative explainability of graph neural networks, and proposed a general framework, Cooperative GNN Explanation (CGE), which incorporates LTH and MMI to generate the explanatory subgraph and subnetwork simultaneously.

Cooperative Explanations of Graph Neural Networks

Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

Figure 5: Class-specific Information Flow in ASAP model. Best viewed in color.
Focusing on cooperative explanations allows CGE to endow the conventional feature-based methods with better explainability, and exhibits how the salient information flows by activating and deactivating neurons. Extensive experiments in three datasets show that our method indeed improves the quality of explanatory subgraphs and subnetworks. This work represents an initial attempt to exploit cooperative explainability in GNN’s explanations. In the future, we would like to consider more fine-grained relevancy between input features and model neurons, to analyze the key features which make predictions different.
