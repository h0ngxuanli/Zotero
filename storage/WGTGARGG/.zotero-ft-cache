QUESTIONS TO ASK WHILE READING A RESEARCH ARTICLE
INTRODUCTION – Why did they start? Why is this research important? Is it justified (review of literature?) What is the research question/s of interest (purpose/objectives) or hypothesis? Terms defined?
METHODS – What did they do? Sufficient details for the replication of the study? What’s the study design? Have the data collection procedures and instruments described? Who is the sample population? Does this population place any limits on the generalizability of the results? Was the sampling procedure/subject selection described? Sample size? How was their sample assessed? Was the measure validated? Does the study design have any control group? Is the time frame adequate to answer the research question?
RESULTS – What did they find? Were the number of subjects in each group or subgroup used in the analysis specified? Were the subject characteristics summarized? Did the results relate to the specified objective/hypotheses? Do the tables and figures “speak for themselves?” Are the tables adequately titled, labeled?
DISCUSSION – What do the results mean? Did authors discuss the results in relations to the objectives/hypotheses? Were the results discussed in relation to those from similar studies? Are the authors justified in the strength of the statements they make in the study? Did they offer alternative explanations for results?
REFERENCES – Are they comprehensive and current?
Just a note: Not all of these questions apply to all of the articles, nor are these the only questions to ask about a study. These are just some ideas to get you started. These questions represent an approach to critically evaluating the research literature.
