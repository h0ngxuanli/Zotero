ABSTRACT
Data is one of the most critical resources in the AI Era. While substantial research has been dedicated to training machine learning models using various types of data, much less efforts have been invested in the exploration of assessing and governing data assets in end-to-end processes of machine learning and data science, that is, the pipeline where data is collected and processed, and then machine learning models are produced, requested, deployed, shared and evolved. To provide a state-of-the-art overall picture of this important and novel area and advocate the related research and development, we present a tutorial addressing two essential problems. First, in the pipeline of machine learning, how can data and machine learning models be priced properly so that contributions from various parties can be assessed and recognized in a fair manner? Second, in the collaboration among many parties in building, distributing and sharing machine learning models, how can data as assets be managed? Accordingly, the first part of our proposal surveys data and model pricing in the pipeline of machine learning, while the second part discusses data asset governance for collaborative artificial intelligence. Each part is self-contained. At the same time, the two parts echo each other and connect a series of interesting and important problems into a dynamic big picture.

1 INTRODUCTION
Data is one of the most critical resources in the AI Era. While substantial research has been dedicated to training machine learning models using various types of data, much less efforts have been invested in the exploration of assessing and governing data assets in end-to-end processes of machine learning and data science, that is, the pipeline where data is collected and processed, and then machine learning models are produced, requested, deployed, shared and evolved.
There are two essential issues about data assets in the end-to-end processes of AI and data science. First, building powerful machine learning models, particularly deep learning models, requires large amounts of data. Much data may be acquired from external sources. Moreover, many parties share their machine learning models as a service (MLaas) so that they can monetize their data assets and intellectual property in a timely manner. As data is used in every step of building and delivering machine learning models and services, how can data and machine learning models be priced properly so that contributions from various parties can be assessed and recognized in a fair manner? Second, the nature of big data today entails an increasingly decentralized setting where data from various sources would be contributed to achieve data intelligence in a collaborative manner. How can we govern data assets peculiar to decentralized data collaboration under the two principles of trust and incentive, including consensus, privacy, data auditing, data accounting and incentive design?
To provide a state-of-the-art overall picture of this novel and important area and advocate the related research and development, we present a tutorial addressing the above two essential problems. Accordingly, our tutorial consists of two parts. The first part surveys data and model pricing in the pipeline of machine learning. The second part discusses data asset governance for collaborative artificial intelligence. Each part is elf-contained and takes 3 hours. At the same time, the two parts echo each other and connect a series of interesting and important problems into a dynamic big picture.

Tutorial Overview

KDD ’21, August 14–18, 2021, Virtual Event, Singapore

2 DATA AND MODEL PRICING IN THE
PIPELINE OF MACHINE LEARNING
In the first part of the tutorial, we systematically review the stateof-the-art research and development in the end-to-end process of machine learning, and discuss the principles, opportunities, and challenges. We start with a quick introduction to end-to-end supply chain of data and machine learning, and review the essential principles in pricing data and machine learning models. Then, we focus on the practice of pricing in the three important components of machine learning, namely pricing in data collection, pricing in collaborative training of machine learning models, and pricing in machine learning model deployment.
This part contains the following sections.
(1) Introduction: machine learning pipeline, data and machine learning models as economic goods
(2) Essentials of pricing data and machine learning models: data markets, data and model pricing desiderata, pricing strategies
(3) Pricing in data collection – pricing raw data: pricing general data sets, pricing crowdsourcing tasks and data, pricing data queries, compensating privacy loss
(4) Pricing in data collection – pricing data labels: gold taskbased pricing models, peer prediction-based pricing models
(5) Pricing in collaborative training of machine learning models: revenue allocation by Shapley value, other revenue allocation methods
(6) Pricing in machine learning model deployment: pricing machine learning models, pricing raw data versus machine learning models
(7) Summary and future directions
3 DATA ASSET FOR COLLABORATIVE
INTELLIGENCE
The second part of the tutorial is devoted to the task of establishing data as a new class of assets for collaborative intelligence setting. We start with a systematic introduction to the notion of data asset, examining the three key components of value, right and control. As the sustainable success of any data economy relies on sound data asset governance, we then focus on the two critical governing principles of "trust" and "incentive". Various components of each principle are explored based on a wide range of technologies including consensus protocols, distributed ledgers, federated learning, data auditing and tokenomics design.
This part is presented with the following sections.
(1) Background and motivation of data asset (2) Three core components of data asset: value, right and control (3) Data asset governance for decentralized collaborative intelli-
gence – principles, dimensions and mechanisms (4) “Trust” for data asset governance – attacking models, agree-
ment, accounting, auditing and privacy (5) “Incentive” for data asset governance – focusing on toke-
nomics design (6) Data economy ecosystem case studies for both personal data
and B-to-B application settings (7) Summary and future directions
