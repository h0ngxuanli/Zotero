Hydra's command line flags

Hydra is using the command line for two things:

    Controlling Hydra
    Configuring your application (See Override Grammar )

Arguments prefixed by - or -- control Hydra; the rest are used to configure the application.

Information about Hydra:

    --hydra-help : Shows Hydra specific flags
    --version : Show Hydra's version and exit

Information provided by the Hydra app:

    --help,-h : Shows the application's help. This can be customized .

Debugging assistance:

    --cfg,-c : Show config instead of running. Takes as parameter one of job , hydra or all .
    --resolve : Used in conjunction with the --cfg flag; resolve interpolations in the config before printing it.
    --package,-p : Used in conjunction with --cfg to select a specific config package to show.
    --info,-i : Print Hydra information. This includes installed plugins, Config Search Path, Defaults List, generated config and more.

Running Hydra applications:

    --run,-r : Run is the default mode and is not normally needed.
    --multirun,-m : Run multiple jobs with the configured launcher and sweeper. See Multi-run .

    --config-path,-cp : Overrides the config_path specified in hydra.main() . The config_path is absolute or relative to the Python file declaring @hydra.main() .
    --config-name,-cn : Overrides the config_name specified in hydra.main() .
    --config-dir,-cd : Adds an additional config directory to the config search path .
    This is useful for installed apps that want to allow their users to provide additional configs.

Misc:

    --shell-completion,-sc : Install or Uninstall shell tab completion .
