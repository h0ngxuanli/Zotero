Transfer learning and federated machine learning are both techniques used in the field of machine learning, but they have some key differences in their approach and application.

    Transfer Learning: Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model, typically trained on a large dataset, is used as a starting point for a new, related task. The idea is to leverage the knowledge learned from one task to improve the performance of a different but related task. The pre-trained model, often called the "source model," is fine-tuned on the new task using a smaller dataset specific to the new task, called the "target task." Transfer learning can save computational resources and training time, as the pre-trained model has already learned useful features from the source task that can be beneficial for the target task.
    Federated Machine Learning: Federated machine learning, on the other hand, is a distributed machine learning approach where multiple entities collaborate to train a shared machine learning model while keeping their data locally, without sharing the raw data with a central server. Each entity, often referred to as a "node" or "client," has its own local dataset and trains the model on that dataset using its own computational resources. The updates to the model are typically shared with a central server or coordinator, which aggregates the updates and updates the shared model. The idea behind federated machine learning is to enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data, which can be beneficial in scenarios where data privacy and security are concerns, such as in healthcare or finance. 

In summary, transfer learning is a technique that uses a pre-trained model to improve the performance of a related task by leveraging knowledge from a source task, while federated machine learning is a distributed approach where multiple entities collaborate to train a shared model without sharing raw data. Transfer learning focuses on reusing learned features from one task to another, while federated machine learning focuses on distributed training of a shared model across multiple entities with local data.

Transfer learning is the ability to take a complex model that was trained for some task A, using a HUGE amount of training data and compute resources, and then with a tiny bit of incremental work (small amount of data, small amount of resources) - you tune it to support a new task B. It's usually driven mostly by sample efficiency (especially when you simply don't have a lot of samples for task B), and compute efficiency. Some examples are:

    Train a large CNN on the general task of image classification for the most common 1000 image classes (often such a task may run for a few days over billions

Transfer learning is the process of optimising a previously trained model's performance on a new task, whereas federated machine learning is the process of training a model across numerous devices without exchanging data, protecting privacy. When training data is few, transfer learning is helpful, whereas federated machine learning is helpful when training data is dispersed among several devices.

Transfer learning is used to transfer the learning of a model trained on a similar data or task distribution to a new situation. It mostly consists of finding a better starting point to begin training.

Federated learning is just any environment where the training is spread out over multiple computers and generally incurs network latency in certain parts of the algorithms due to this but it also allows better parallelization for faster training at the cost of more compute power.

Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task.

What is the difference between machine learning and statistics?

Great question! I always begin my first lecture of my graduate ML course with this question. I like analogies, so the best way to explain the answer is through an analogy.

ML is to statistics as engineering is to physics.

How does civil or electrical or mechanical engineering differ from physics? The latter is the study of fundamental laws of the universe, of matter, of conservation of energy and symmetry etc. The former engineering fields are attempts to build structures, gadgets, machines that build on the deep knowledge of the universe that physics gives us.

What is the main drawback of federated learning? Would federated learning become the future of machine leaning?

Personally, an issue I am facing right now is that, while doing cross-silo FL, the characteristics of the data available with each silo will be very different from each other. Even for simple numeric datasets, if the distribution of features in one silo is different from that in another, during model aggregation, the global model will suffer, despite local models being accurate models independently. This violation of IID across different silos/devices is one of the problems associated with FL that increases overall bias.

What is transfer learning in the context of artificial intelligence?

Within the context of deep learning (DL), transfer learning is the process of taking all, or a portion (subset of layers and their learned parameters) of an existing, i.e., pre-trained model, and applying to a different yet related task.

For example, suppose you want to build a model to identify and locate (place a bounding box around) your family’s cat in images. Instead of starting completely from scratch, you can start by taking all or part of a high-performing convolutional neural network (a.k.a.

Originally Answered: In machine learning, what is the difference between the terms 'transfer learning', 'multitask learning', 'inductive transfer', 'meta-learning', and 'learning to learn'?

Meta learning is a part of machine learning theory in which some algorithms are applied on meta data about the case to improve a machine learning process. The meta data includes properties about the algorithm used, learning task itself etc. Using the meta data, one can make a better decision of chosen learning algorithm(s) to solve the problem more efficiently.

Why do we use federated learning?

There are many reasons why federated learning (FL) is used. These include, but are not limited to, privacy concerns, the hunt for fresh data, cooperation between competitors and compute cost mitigation.

Privacy With FL, machine learning models are trained in a decentralized fashion and data samples never leave their original location. While the FL process can indirectly leak information on the underlying data samples, it prevents a direct data vacuuming. Therefore, FL is appealing for sensitive data whose owners do not want to share in a blind fashion. This applies e.g. to phones’ keyboards his

Transfer learning only works if the initial and target problems are similar enough for the first round of training to be relevant. Developers can draw reasonable conclusions about what type of training counts as “similar enough” to the target, but the algorithm doesn’t have to agree. If the first round of training is too far off the mark, the model may actually perform worse than if it had never been trained at all.

Each worker holds a local (often private) training dataset, with which it contributes to training a global model. Specifically, in each FL round, each worker computes the error of the global model by forward-propagating the samples of its own dataset through the model, followed by comparing the model’s outputs with samples’ labels and applying an appropriate loss function.
