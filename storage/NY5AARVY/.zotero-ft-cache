Abstract Data are invaluable. How can we assess the value of data objectively, systematically and quantitatively? Pricing data, or information goods in general, has been studied and practiced in dispersed areas and principles, such as economics, marketing, electronic commerce, data management, data mining and machine learning. In this article, we present a uniﬁed, interdisciplinary and comprehensive overview of this important direction. We examine various motivations behind data pricing, understand the economics of data pricing and review the development and evolution of pricing models according to a series of fundamental principles. We discuss both digital products and data products. We also consider a series of challenges and directions for future work.
1 Introduction
In this digital economics era, data are well recognized as an essential resource for work and life. Many products and services are delivered purely in digital forms. Many big data applications are built on the second use or reuse of data [196], that is, the same data are customized and reused by many applications for diﬀerent purposes. The extensive sharing and reusing data has profound implications to economy. For example, digital maps are often produced for traﬃc and directions as the immediate usage. However, Nagaraj [153] ﬁnds that mining activities were strongly beneﬁted by open maps or maps sponsored by governments, particularly for smaller ﬁrms with

less resources. Universal availability of data often helps minority parties and emerging initiatives.
In business and economic activities where data are shared, exchanged and reused, it is essential to measure the value of data properly. While there exist many possible ways to appreciate and represent the value of data, a general approach that can be scalable for massive applications and acceptable to many parties is to set a price at which data can be sold or purchased, that is, data pricing. The importance of pricing in business is well recognized in ﬁnancial modeling [120], as price being one of the four Ps of the marketing mix1.
Pricing data is far from trivial. Data have many diﬀerent aspects. Consequently, the term “price of data” may carry diﬀerent meanings and refer to diﬀerent properties of data. To illustrate the complexity, let us quickly consider the following three scenarios involving price information related to data.
• Data transmission. Imagine the scenario where a mobile service provider oﬀers a smart phone user the price of its data package. Here, the price is quoted for the data transmission service and is decided by several factors, such as the amount of data the user wants to transmit in a month time, the location (roaming or not, for example), and the transmission speed. The price does not include and is independent from the content, that is, what the data are about, such as data quality, and how the data are collected, stored or processed.
• Digital products. Imagine that a person wants to watch a movie at home. This is a purchase of data, since the movie is sent to the customer’s home as a stream of bits. The price here typically is related to the content, but is independent from the data transmission service, that is, how the data are transmitted to the user’s home.
• Data products. Many logistics companies want to pay for weather information to support their business operations. While historical data are relevant, more often than not those companies want to subscribe to weather forecasting information instead. Some companies may want
1The four Ps are product, price, place and promotion [120].

weather predictions at a higher granularity while some may want detailed predictions at speciﬁc locations. Moreover, some may want long term predictions while some others may want short term projections. Here, prediction services are sold as data products.
The above three cases just elaborate some representative scenarios where data prices are used, and are by no means exhaustive. To appreciate data pricing, including ideas, principles and methods, we have to take an interdisciplinary approach from multiple ﬁelds, economics and data science being the two most prominent. Indeed, the studies and practice of data pricing started as early as the dawn of digital economics, and are highly diversiﬁed and rich in innovative thinking.
In this article, we try to present a comprehensive survey on data pricing, an emerging research and practice area that plays a more and more important role in the current big data and AI economics era. Our survey is highly related to the current strong rising of data science. To a large extent, data pricing is an overdue pillar in data science research and practice.
Data and information as goods discussed in this article are those that are distributed purely in digital form. We focus on two categories of the most interest: pricing digital products and pricing data products, demonstrated by the last two aforementioned scenarios, respectively. In this article, digital products refer to those intangible goods but can be consumed through electronics, such as e-books, downloadable musics, online ads, and internet coupons. Many digital products have physical correspondences in one way or another, though not absolutely necessary. Data products refer to data sets as products and information services derived from data sets. We build the linkage between these two categories by pointing out many ideas and methods on pricing digital products can be generalized and applied to pricing data products. In some scenarios, the boundary between digital products and data products is also blurry. Hereafter, we use the term information goods to refer to both digital products and data products.
1.1 Related Surveys
The research into data pricing happens simultaneously in multiple domains, including but not limited to economics, marketing, e-commerce, databases and data management, operational research, management science, machine
3

learning and AI. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists very limited eﬀort to provide an interdisciplinary survey of the related work. This article presents our endeavor to produce a comprehensive picture.
There are some previous surveys related to data pricing. For example, Liang et al. [136] survey the life cycle of big data, and reviews 11 data pricing models. They also discuss data trading and protection. Fricker and Maksimov [75] report a literature survey over 18 research articles regarding several research questions, including maturity of the pricing models. Very recently, Zhang and Beltr´an [220] review the state-of-the-art data pricing methods. They categorize data pricing methods according to two important data properties, granularity and privacy, This article covers a substantially broader scope than those [75, 136, 220]. We connect economics, digital product pricing and data product pricing. We also discuss a series of desirable properties in data pricing, including arbitrage-freeness, revenue maximization, fairness, truthfulness, and privacy preservation, and review the techniques achieving those properties.
Data pricing is related to cloud pricing, since a lot of data for pricing and trading are hosted on cloud. Wu et al. [208] present a comprehensive survey on cloud pricing models. They systematically categorize three fundamental pricing strategies, namely value-based pricing, cost-based pricing and market-based pricing. Then, they further categorize nine pricing tactical objects. Speciﬁcally, value-based pricing is demand driven and consists of customer value-based pricing, experience-based pricing, and service-based pricing. Cost-based pricing is supply driven and consists of expenditurebased pricing, resource-based pricing and utility-based pricing. Marketbased pricing is an equilibrium of supply and demand and consists of free and pay later pricing, retail-based pricing and auction and online pricing. They cover in total 60 pricing models. While data and cloud are highly related, data pricing and cloud pricing are fundamentally diﬀerent. Data pricing is selling data, while cloud pricing is selling cloud resources (e.g., storage and computation), including physical resources, virtual resources and stateless resources.
In addition, Sen et al. [181] survey the major broad-band pricing proposals, including the realizations in various consumer data plans around the world. Murthy et al. [150] list diﬀerent pricing models and pricing schemes used by some popular IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) providers.
4

Wu et al. [211] propose pricing as a service, which is essentially a personalized pricing service for IaaS. Aazam and Huh [1] propose broker as a service, which matches cloud services among cloud service providers and users. The key idea is to predict resource demands and thus derive prices.
As data are often hosted online, one interesting question is the fair sharing of the cost among data owners, data users and brokers. This is related to data pricing, because the costs of data hosting and processing have to be recovered from data pricing. Kantere et al. [116] study the fair allocation of costs in query services. They develop a stochastic model, which predicts the extent of cost amortization in time and number of services based on query traﬃc statistics. The model can be implemented on top of a cloud DBMS. Al-Kiswany et al. [12] provide a cost assessment tool to evaluate the cost of a desired data sharing. One useful feature of the tool is that a user can explore the cost space of alternative conﬁgurations using various factors, such as quality, staleness, and accuracy. The technique is based on what-if analysis.
1.2 Structure of This Survey
We take a multi-disciplinary approach in this survey. The rest of the article is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we start from economics and focus on two aspects. First, we discuss cost reduction in information goods that contributes to their prices and has impact on economics. Then, we discuss the diﬀerences between digital products and data products.
In Section 3, we discuss the fundamental principles of data pricing. We ﬁrst present versioning as a general framework for pricing information goods. Then, we identify several desirable properties in data pricing, including truthfulness, fairness, revenue-maximization, arbitrage-freeness, privacy preservation and computational eﬃciency.
In Section 4, we discuss pricing digital products. We ﬁrst review the three major streams of revenues for digital products. Then, we revisit the bundling and subscription planning pricing models. Last, we consider auctions, which are widely used in pricing digital products.
In Section 5, we discuss pricing data products. We ﬁrst overview the structures, players, and ways to produce data products in data marketplaces.
5

Then, we examine several important areas in pricing data products, including arbitrage-free pricing, revenue maximization pricing, fair and truthful pricing, privacy preservation in pricing. We also discuss dynamic data pricing, online pricing, and pricing in federated and collaborative learning.
Last, in Section 6, we discuss challenges and future directions.
2 Economics of Data Pricing
In general, pricing is the practice that a business sets a price at which a product or a service can be sold. Pricing is often part of the marketing plan of a business. To set prices, a business often considers a series of objectives, such as proﬁtability, ﬁtness in marketplace, market positioning, price consistency across categories and products, and meeting or preventing competition. Some major pricing strategies in literature [38, 58, 108, 155, 159] include operation-oriented pricing, revenue-oriented pricing, customeroriented pricing, value-oriented pricing, and relationship-oriented pricing. There is a rich body of studies in economics and marketing research on pricing tactics, which are far beyond the scope and capacity of this survey.
In this section, to understand the economic factors speciﬁc to data pricing, we examine the cost reduction in information goods. Then, we inspect the diﬀerences between digital products and data as products.
2.1 Cost Reduction in Information Goods
“Technology changes. Economic laws do not.” [182] The production, distribution, and consumption of information goods, comparing to those of physical products in the long history of human economies, are distinguished by signiﬁcant cost reductions on ﬁve aspects, namely search costs, production costs, replication costs, transportation costs, and tracking and veriﬁcation costs. Essentially, digital and data economics investigates how standard economic models adjust when those costs are reduced dramatically. Goldfarb and Tucker [93] present a thorough discussion, whose framework is largely followed here.
6

2.1.1 Search Costs
“Search costs are the costs of looking for information” [182], which are incurred in any information collection activities. Information goods allow more eﬀective and eﬃcient online search. The consequent low search costs facilitate users’ discovering digital products and data sets, as well as comparing prices of similar products and services. For example, Brynjolfsson and Smith [40] show that online prices of books and CDs are clearly lower than oﬄine, though the price dispersion, however, does not shrink accordingly.
Low search costs facilitate the sales of rare and long tail products [15, 214]. Thus, more variety is often observed in information goods and services. The degree of variety may be heavily impacted by recommender systems. Speciﬁc to consumption of media, one of the major categories of digital products, Gentzkow and Shapiro [82] show that online media consumption is more diverse than oﬄine. At the same time, customers may tend to consume more that aligns more or less with their viewpoints, which is called the “echo chamber” eﬀect [188].
Low search costs give strong rise to the prevalent platform businesses, which provide extensive matching services to customers and improve trade eﬃciency [115]. Interoperability, compatibility and standards are strategic tools for both building platforms and running platform businesses [99].
2.1.2 Production Costs
Producing digital products, such as online courses, eBooks, software, graphics and digital arts, and photography, is very diﬀerent from manufacturing physical products, like bread, shoes, and jackets. Moreover, collecting and processing massive data so that parts of data can be sold and can meet customers’ needs is also diﬀerent from traditional production. A wide spectrum of production costs in traditional products are substantially reduced in information goods.
First, some essential major costs in traditional production, such as materials, semi-ﬁnished products and their transportation, are dramatically reduced in producing information goods. In many cases, the costs of obtaining, producing and transporting raw materials and physical semi-ﬁnished products can be reduced to very low or can even approach zero in making information goods. Second, a substantial cost of a traditional physical
7

product often belongs to the product itself and cannot be further reduced through sharing. The unit costs of information goods can approach zero through sharing as long as there are suﬃcient reuses and sales volume. Last, smart manufacturing and customer-to-manufacturing can reduce the supply chain costs in traditional physical production [88, 187]. Information goods often can reduce the costs of customization to extreme.
The substantial reduction in production cost in materials, semi-ﬁnished products, customization and sharing gives rise to a series of innovative business models, such as economics of sharing, pay-as-you-go and query-based data consumption. This also encourages innovation and long tail products that address diverse and smaller groups of potential customers.
2.1.3 Replication Costs
One distinct feature of information goods versus traditional products is that information goods are non-rival. That is, one customer consuming an information good does not reduce the amount or quality of the product available to other customers. The zero marginal costs and the non-rival property of information goods empower innovative opportunities and bring in new challenges.
In order to structure pricing of a large variety of non-rival information goods with zero marginal costs, bundling is often used [182], that is, multiple products are sold together at a single price. Since a large number of information goods can be bundled together without a substantial increase in cost, economically it may be optimal to bundle thousands of digital products together to meet diverse and independent customer preferences [10, 25, 26].
Due to the zero marginal costs and the non-rivalrous property, many information goods are made publicly available, such as Wikipedia2 and open source software [131]. People contribute to open source or publicly available digital products and data to demonstrate their professional skills to potential employers. Companies support those products to complement their sales on other products.
The zero marginal costs and non-rivalrous property post challenges to copyright policies and enforcement. Waldfogel [203] shows that low replication costs, though may reduce revenue, help supplies and demands, and
2https://www.wikipedia.org
8

thus boost quality. Williams [207] shows that the protection of intellectual properties indeed has negative impact on follow-on innovation in gene sequencing.
At the same time, there are evidences showing that governments mandate “open data” may lead to data leakages and privacy breaches that aﬀect citizens’ oﬄine welfare [5]. On the negative side, the zero marginal costs or non-rivalrous nature also ease the way for spamming [174] and online crime [149].
2.1.4 Transportation Costs
Thanks to the Internet, the costs of transporting information goods approach zero. This may imply, in many scenarios, that local communities may not aﬀect adoptions and consumptions of information goods, often known as the eﬀect of ﬂat world [76]. Interestingly, this is not true all the time, as some studies demonstrate that tastes may still be local in music [73] and content consumption [81].
While the physical transportation may approach zero, regulation may put sophisticated constraints on locations. For example, when Wekipedia was blocked in China in October 2005, more contributors from outside China were motivated to contribute [221]. Copyright policies may also aﬀect the availability and consumption of information goods in diﬀerent regions, such as news media [46], and thus may be reﬂected by price.
2.1.5 Tracking and Veriﬁcation Costs
The capability of tracking users with relatively low costs is an important feature of information goods [182]. The low tracking costs give the rise to extensive personalized markets and possible price discrimination [77, 165]. Behavioral price discrimination is an immediate type, which sets prices according to customers’ previous behavior. Correspondingly, if customers are well aware of the beneﬁts of tracking information to a monopoly, they may likely choose to be privacy sensitive and hold the information [193]. Another type of price discrimination is versioning [183], which sells information at diﬀerent prices to diﬀerent customers using diﬀerent versions. Versioning is discussed in detail in Section 3.1.
9

The advantage of low tracking costs also leads to the blooming businesses of personalized advertising [69]. A challenge for a company, however, is how to set prices for many advertisements that may be shown to massive customers? The same advertisement may have diﬀerent prices for diﬀerent customers. Auctions are often used to address the challenge [19], and can even be used to discover prices for information goods [164]. At the same time, auctions may be less useful when online marketplaces become mature [66].
The low tracking costs and the consequences, such as price discrimination, lead to serious concerns on privacy [4]. As to be discussed later in this article, whether privacy should be treated as goods and how privacy is priced are investigated [74, 163]. Moreover, privacy regulation and the impact on welfare are important topics, though they are far beyond the scope of this survey.
As a byproduct of low tracking costs, the costs of verifying identity and reputation of producers and users of information goods are dramatically lower than those in traditional scenarios. The low veriﬁcation costs facilitate online transactions extensively and lower the costs of trust dramatically.
2.2 Diﬀerences between Digital Products and Data Products
This survey focuses on pricing two categories of information goods, digital products and data products. While digital products and data products share a series of common ideas and methods in pricing, they are also essentially diﬀerent from each other on at least four aspects.
First, the units of digital products are often well deﬁned and ﬁxed. For example, individual movies and musics are often priced and sold in whole. The consumption of a digital product is often independent from each other. For example, it would be rare that two digital books have to be read at the same time. In contrast, although the basic unit in a data set can be at a very small granularity, such as a record in a relational table, the units for pricing and consumption often vary from one customer to another. For example, a customer may be interested in the sales data of female customers in a province, while another customer may be interested in the sales data on electronics during the Christmas season. Correspondingly, one individual unit of data at the lowest granularity may not be valuable as a data product.
10

For example, one customer purchase record, after proper anonymization, may not be useful for a retailer. Instead, more often than not, many basic units of data are combined, aggregated and consumed together.
Second, diﬀerent from digital products, data sets as data products have very strong and ﬂexible aggregateability. Customers often aggregate data using various dimensions. The aggregateability, on the one hand, enables many opportunities for innovations in data business, and, on the other hand, posts many technical and business challenges, such as ensuring arbitragefreeness as to be discussed later in this article. In many business scenarios, digital products like movies and musics are bundled. However, bundles are not aggregates. Customers still get digital products and consume them individually. Bundling is to take the advantage of low replication costs of digital products to boost sales and meet customers’ diverse demands [10,25, 26].
Third, the means of consuming digital products and data products are also very diﬀerent. Typically digital products are consumed directly by people, such as movies watched by people and musics enjoyed by fans. Data sets are more often than not consumed by computers. They are, for example, analyzed, summarized or used to train machine learning models. The outputs of models are used to automate operations or support human decision making.
Last, digital products and data products are dramatically diﬀerent in ways to be reused and resold. Digital products are easy to be consumed by others, that is, to be reused, or even to be resold to others in whole. Data sets, to the contrary, can be reused by others in diﬀerent ways, such as aggregation in diﬀerent dimensions and analysis for diﬀerent purposes. Moreover, data can be easily processed and transformed so that they can be resold in a hard-to-detect manner.
The above diﬀerences between digital products and data products lead to diﬀerent considerations in pricing principles and methods, which are discussed later. Before we leave this topic, we want to point out that it is possible that the same information can be regarded as digital products in some situations and as data products in some other situations. For example, social media like tweets and customer reviews can be regarded as digital products when a customer reads them online. At the same time, they can be collected and processed in batch by analytic tools to detect events, dis-
11

cover customer proﬁles and feed recommender systems. In this situation, a systematic collection of social media can be priced and sold as a data product.
2.3 Summary
In summary, information goods, including digital products and data products, distinguish themselves from the traditional physical products in signiﬁcant cost reductions, particularly in search costs, production costs, replication costs, transportation costs, and tracking and veriﬁcation costs. The signiﬁcant reduction of costs has profound impact on pricing information goods, which is discussed in the later sections of this article. There are several major diﬀerences between digital products and data products, including consumption units, aggregatebility, means of consumption, and reusing and reselling.
3 Fundamental Principles of Data Pricing
In this section, we ﬁrst review the idea of versioning [182, 183], which is a fundamental framework of designing information goods and pricing them. Then, we review several important properties in cost models of digital and data products.
3.1 Versioning
As the replication costs of information goods are very low, even approaching zero in many cases, the price of an information good tends to be very low in marketplaces, too. The potential of very low prices of information goods, on the one hand, makes information goods economically appealing, and, on the other hand, may also make information goods economically dangerous, as the competitors may easily enter the market [182, 183]. This dilemma keeps many traditional pricing strategies far away from being eﬀective for information goods.
To tackle the dilemma, the core idea is “linking price to value”, that is, setting the price reﬂecting the value that a customer places on the information. Speciﬁcally, the versioning strategy [183] makes diﬀerent versions to appeal to diﬀerent types of customers. For example, for a piece of software,
12

diﬀerent versions have diﬀerent subsets of features. Diﬀerent versions of a movie may provide diﬀerent image resolutions and sound eﬀects. Essentially, versioning divides customers into subgroups so that each subgroup may regard some features highly valuable and some other features of little value. A version corresponding to the demands can be provided.
There are many diﬀerent ways to produce diﬀerent versions of information goods. For example, as information is often time sensitive, delay is often a good basis. In stock market information services, an expensive version may deliver real time quotes while a basic version delivers the same information 20 minutes later. In addition, versions may be deﬁned by convenience (e.g., data can be accessed only by PDF ﬁle or by downloadable spreadsheet), comprehensiveness (e.g., the length of historical data available), manipulation (e.g., whether users can store, duplicate, print the information), community (e.g., availability of posting and reading discussion boards), annoyance (e.g., the option of no advertisements), the means of customer support (e.g., by website only or by talking to experts), and many other factors. Most versions of information goods are created by subtracting value from the most technologically advanced and complete version.
In many situations where customers may not realize the value of an information good unless they try it, even the free versions may be provided. The rationale is that the free versions can provide opportunities to potential customers to test out. The objectives of oﬀering free versions include building awareness, gaining follow-on sales, creating a customer network, attracting attentions, and gaining competitive advantages.
The number of versions of an information good may be decided by two major considerations. First, the characteristics of the information to be sold is important. An information good that can be used in many diﬀerent ways opens the door to many diﬀerent versions. The second important factor is the value that diﬀerent customers may place on it. The larger the variance, the more versions may be needed.
The versioning strategy has been investigated in pricing data products, for example, relational data sets and query results [27, 28]. Relational views provide a natural and ﬂexible technical mean to produce versions of an information source. A series of technical challenges are identiﬁed, such as arbitrage in pricing, ﬁne-grained data pricing, pricing updates, integrated data and competing data sources, which are reviewed further in this article.

3.2 Important Desiderata in Data Pricing
There are many diﬀerent ways to design and implement pricing models for information goods. There are a small number of desiderata pursued by most models. How to implement those desiderata in pricing models is discussed in the later sections.
3.2.1 Truthfulness
To make a market eﬃcient, the market is preferred to be truthful. A market is truthful if every buyer is selﬁsh and only oﬀers the price that maximizes the buyer’s true utility value. In other words, in a truthful market, no buyer pays more than suﬃcient to purchase a product. Here, diﬀerent buyers may have diﬀerent utility values on the same product. Truthfulness can facilitate a wide spectrum of pricing mechanisms, such as many kinds of auctions [7]. Auctions of digital products are discussed in Section 4.3.
3.2.2 Revenue Maximization
Pricing models can optimize diﬀerent objectives, such as lowest cost, highest proﬁt, and largest sales. The objective of maximizing revenue is often of special interest in designing pricing strategies. The rationale is that, for a business to be successful long term, a more immediate and important requirement is to win over as many customers as possible.
For traditional physical products, it is often assumed that the marginal cost goes up after a certain number of units are manufactured, and thus the proﬁt can be maximized if the output level is set so that the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost, and the revenue can be maximized if the marginal revenue becomes zero. However, given that the replication costs of information goods are very low, revenue maximization and proﬁt maximization for information products become quite diﬀerent from those for physical products [7, 42].
3.2.3 Fairness
Essentially, a market is fair if each seller gets the fair share of the revenue in coalition. In his seminal article [184], Shapley lays out the fundamental requirements of fairness in markets. Suppose there are k sellers cooperatively
14

participate in a transaction that leads to a payment v. There are four basic requirements for being fair.

• Balance: the sum of the payment to each seller should be equal to v. That is, the payment is fully distributed to all sellers.

• Symmetry: for a set of sellers S and two additional sellers s and s who are not in S, that is, s, s ∈ S, if S ∪ {s} and S ∪ {s } produce the same payment, then s and s should receive the same payment. That is, the same contribution to utility should be paid the same.

• Zero element: for a set of sellers S and an additional seller s ∈ S, if S ∪ {s} and S produce the same payment, then s should receive a payment of 0. That is, no contribution, no payment.

• Additivity: If the goods can be used for two tasks T1 and T2 with payment v1 and v2, respectively, then the payment to complete both tasks T1 + T2 is v1 + v2.

In the above well celebrated Shapley fairness, the Shapley value is the unique allocation of payment that satisﬁes all the requirements.

(2)

where π ∈ Π(D) is a permutation of all sellers, and Piπ is the set of sellers preceding s in π.
Agarwal et al. [7] observe that, as the replication costs of information goods are very low, the marginal costs of production are close to zero, a seller can produce more units of the same information good to obtain a larger Shapley value and thus a larger portion of the payment unjustiﬁed in business. This is a challenge in designing fair marketplace for information goods.

3.2.4 Arbitrage-free Pricing
Arbitrage is the activities that take advantage of price diﬀerences between two or more markets or channels. For example, consider a scenario where a user wants to purchase the access to an article, whose listed price is $35. Suppose that the journal publishing the article has a monthly subscription rate of $25. Then, the user can conduct arbitrage to subscribe to the journal for only one month and obtain the article at a price cheaper than the listed price.
Arbitrage is often undesirable in pricing models. At least it should be able to check whether a pricing model is arbitrage-free. However, arbitrage can sneak in pricing models that are not thoroughly designed. For example, suppose a data service provider sells query results with prices based on variance [133], a variance of 10 for $5 each query result and a variance of 1 for $100 each query result. Each answer is perturbed independently. A customer who wants to obtain an answer of variance of 1 can purchase the query 10 times and compute their average. Due to the independent noise in perturbation, the aggregated average has variance 1, and thus the customer saves $50 by arbitrage.
3.2.5 Privacy-preservation
Privacy is becoming a more and more serious concern about information goods. In general, privacy is the ability of an individual or a group to keep themselves or the information about themselves hidden from being identiﬁed or approached by other people. Privacy is highly related to information and information exchange, which are what information goods about.
As explained in Section 2.1.5, due to the low tracking costs of information goods, it is easier to collect data about user privacy [4]. Whether privacy should be treated as goods and how privacy is priced are investigated [74, 163].
It is highly desirable to preserve privacy in marketplaces of information goods. In general, transactions in a marketplace may disclose privacy of various parties in many diﬀerent ways.
First, privacy of buyers is highly vulnerable. Their identities, the location and time of purchases, speciﬁc products purchased, the purchase prices and total amount may reﬂect their privacy. It has been reported from time
16

to time that e-commerce providers leak customer information by mistakes, such as an accident reported recently3.
Second, privacy of information good providers may also be disclosed. For example, medical treatment information in hospitals is highly valuable for many business companies, such as pharmacy and medical equipment companies. Imagine that hospitals can collect and anonymize medical treatment data properly and provide the corresponding data products in marketplaces so that individual patients cannot be re-identiﬁed. Buyers, however, may be able to infer from the data the successful rates of a speciﬁc treatment in a hospital, which may be regarded as the privacy of the hospital.
Last, transactions in marketplaces may also disclose privacy of a third party involved. For example, an AI technology company may provide machine learning model building services to data product buyers. However, machine learning models may be stolen [194], which are regarded privacy of the AI technology company.
To protect privacy in marketplaces of information goods, various directions are being explored, such as hiding the information about what, when and how much a buyer purchases [11], building decentralized and trustworthy privacy preservation data marketplace [50, 107], investigating the tradeoﬀ between payments and accuracy when privacy presents [160], and aggregating non-veriﬁable information from a privacy-sensitive population [86]. There are many studies on preserving privacy in information goods. We refer interested readers to consult the rich body of surveys [8, 35, 61, 72, 78, 114, 212, 224] and others. We do not discuss further details about general privacy preservation techniques in this article, since privacy preservation techniques are far beyond the scope and capacity of this survey.
3.2.6 Computational Eﬃciency
As many information goods may be sold to a huge number of potential buyers, a pricing model has to match goods/sellers and buyers with an appropriate price. Computing prices eﬃciently with respect to a large number of goods and a large number of buyers presents technical challenges [28].

For example, one reasonable expectation is that a marketplace is polynomial, that is, the complexity of computing prices has to be polynomial with respect to the number of sellers, and cannot grow with respect to the number of goods/buyers when prices are updated [7]. When auctions are used in determining prices, auction eﬃciency [92] is required to be fast, which is the time needed to process bids.
3.3 Summary
Versioning is a common mechanism in designing and pricing information goods, so that prices of diﬀerent versions can be linked to values placed by various customer groups. There are a series of important requirements on pricing information goods, including truthfulness, revenue maximization, fairness, arbitrage-free pricing, privacy preservation, and computational efﬁciency. Those requirements post technical challenges to pricing models.
4 Pricing Digital Products
Although the focus of this article is about pricing data products, we provide a brief review on pricing digital products here, since some general ideas in pricing digital products can be borrowed and extended to data products. In some cases, the boundary between digital products and data products is even blurry.
We ﬁrst discuss the three major streams of revenues for digital products. Then, we look at two major types of pricing models. The ﬁrst is bundling and subscription, and the second is auctions. These pricing models are popularly adopted by digital product marketplaces.
4.1 Streams of Revenues
As discussed in Section 3.2.2, revenue maximization often serves as the basic objective in pricing mechanisms, including pricing digital products. Therefore, the understanding of pricing digital products can naturally start with an analysis of possible ways where revenues of digital products may come from.
Lambrecht et al. [127] summarize that there are three streams of revenues for digital products that are delivered online.
18

• Money. A provider can sell to customers content or, more broadly, services, such as movies and e-books.
• Information/privacy. Instead of charging customers directly, a provider can collect customer information by tracking (e.g., using cookies) and sell the information about customers to generate revenues.
• Time/attention. A provider can sell space in their digital products to advertisers to produce revenue.
Often, a ﬁrm has to design a revenue model for its digital products that combine more than one revenue stream. The three streams are not independent. Instead, they compete with each other, and thus a good tradeoﬀ has to be settled [79]. On the one hand, in some situations, revenues from money stream may be increased at the cost of those from time/attention stream. For example, customers may pay for the content and avoid ads [168,171], or convert from free versions to premium versions with ﬁtting functions [202]. On the other hand, customers may be highly price sensitive in some digital products, and thus growth in time/attention stream may be easier. For example, an online news site experiences a dramatic loss of customer visits after introducing a paywall [45]. Free samples may stimulate long-term sales [37]. A possible tradeoﬀ between money and time/attention has to be carefully designed.
Typical approaches in revenue models of content and services [173] include rigid pricing (e.g., each movie is priced at a ﬁxed price), designing pricing tiers (e.g., basic versus premium versions), setting up duration of subscription plans (e.g., 6 months of promotion period with very low subscription price) and designing freemium models. One important and unique feature in digital product consumption is micropayments, which means a customer can pay a very small amount that is typically impractical in traditional transactions using standard credit cards due to network service fees. Micropayments and subscriptions have diﬀerent eﬀects on consumer behavior [20].
As a concrete example of revenue models, consider pricing software products [130]. The major parameters of pricing models include formation of price, structure of payment ﬂow, assessment base, price discrimination, price building and dynamic strategies. The formation of price considers price determination, that is, cost-based, value-based or competition-oriented, as well
19

as degree of interaction, unilateral versus interactive. In terms of payment ﬂow, it may be by single payment, recurring payments or combination. The assessment base of pricing may be usage-dependent (e.g., by transaction or time) or usage-independent (e.g., server types and GPU).
As the tracking costs of digital products are low, a ﬁrm can collect customer personal data and sell such data for revenue, that is, generating revenues from information/privacy stream. Typically, personal data may include customers’ identities, behavior patterns, preferences and needs. There are various ways to sell customer data, which are also discussed in Section 5 when data products and their marketplaces are discussed. For example [32, 36], a website can provide direct marketing companies user activity information. Moreover, websites can also collaborate with data management platforms (DMP, for advertising) [67] and produce revenues by facilitating businesses to identify audience segments. For example, the information about how customers are connected in social networks can be used to design customized discounts in marketing campaigns [215]. Bergemann and Bonatti [33] develop a model of pricing customer-level information such that the data about each customer are sold individually and individual queries to the database are priced linearly. As new technologies of customer tracking become available, more pricing models may emerge.
We want to point out that selling customer data, though serves the purpose of selling digital products, crosses the boundary between selling digital products and data products. We review some studies on setting prices for customer data and privacy information in the next section.
To produce revenues from time/attention stream, many digital product producers and service providers embed advertisements in their products in one way or the other, and obtain remarkable or even dominant advertising income. However, as John Wanamaker (1838-1922) wisely said, “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.” It is well recognized that it is hard to accurately measure advertising eﬀects [95, 132]. Advertisers customize ads for online display [190, 216].
One feasible way to improve advertising eﬀectiveness is to combine user information and advertising opportunities. Retargeted advertising [128] is such an approach, which combines customer online and oﬄine behavior data and makes ﬁrms focus on customers showing prior interest in the related products. For example, Athey et al. [21] consider customers with multiple
20

homes and investigate the advertising strategies and eﬀectiveness. In summary, digital product and service suppliers produce rev-
enues through three major streams, money, information/privacy and time/attention. Orthogonally, a ﬁrm can bundle its digital products and also design subscription plans that provide products and services in a speciﬁc period for a price, which is discussed next.
4.2 Bundling and Subscription Planning
Product bundling organizes products or services into bundles, such that a bundle of products or services are for sale as one combined product or service package. Product bundling is a common marketing practice, particularly in the traditional industry like telecommunication services, ﬁnancial services, healthcare, and consumer electronics.
As discussed in Section 2.1.3, the low replication costs of information goods allow prevalent adoption of bundling in pricing digital products [182]. Designing product bundles essentially is a combinatorial optimization problem. The basic and static setting is that a customer wants to buy either one or multiple products at a time, which is investigated well before digital products are available [6]. A series of studies [18, 148, 169] develop pricing strategies with two products under diﬀerent types of bundling. They share the basic assumption that demand for a bundle is elastic comparing to demand for individual products. For example, Armstrong [18] studies the scenarios where products may be substituted or provided by separate sellers.
Bundling multiple products is analyzed, often under the independent value distribution framework [152]. Consider the situation where there are n heterogeneous products for one buyer, and the objective is to maximize expected revenue. Assume that the value distributions on products are independent. That is, for each product xi, the price that a buyer would like to pay for is an arbitrary distribution Di in range [ai, bi], where 0 ≤ ai ≤ bi < ∞, and those distributions D1, . . . , Di are independent from each other. Further assume that the buyer is additive, that is, the buyer’s value for a set of products is the sum of the buyer’s values of those individual products in the set. Babaioﬀ et al. [51] show that either selling each item separately or selling all items together as a grand bundle produces at least
21

a constant fraction of the optimal revenue. This interesting and important

result allows a simple yet eﬀective bundling strategy: either pricing each

product individually or pricing the grand bundle in the expected price. In

practice, many platforms, such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, oﬀer

grand bundle subscription for their products.

More recently, Haghpanah and Hartline [97, 98] show that grand bun-

dle is optimal if more price-sensitive buyers consider the products more

complementary. When multiple buyers are considered, whose preferences

are unknown, Balcan et al. [30] give a simple pricing model that achieves

a surprisingly strong guarantee: in the case of unlimited supplies, a ran-

dom single price achieves expected revenue within a logarithmic factor for

customers with general valuation functions. This result allows great con-

venience in practice, that is, setting a uniform price for all products. It is

easier to price a bundle of a larger number of products, since the law of

large numbers allows to predict customers’ valuations more accurately for a

larger bundle of products [2].

Orthogonal to bundling, subscription is to price the interactions between

customers and a platform over a period of time. Subscribing customers are in

general heterogeneous in both usage rate and value of products. On the one

hand, customers with higher usage rates may prefer subscribing to larger

subscription sets. On the other hand, in order to maximize revenue, the

platform wants customers with lower usage rates to subscribe, and customers

with higher usage rates to rent. Moreover, diﬀerent users may have diﬀerent

values for a product. Many platforms oﬀer subscription and renting at the

same time. For a platform, the subscription model is to select a subscription

fee and the period for each set of products and also set the rental price for

each product [13].

Alaei et al. [13] follow the model of grand bundle and consider grand

subscription, a single rental price for the set that includes all products. They

establish the suﬃcient and necessary condition for the optimality of grand

subscription. They also show that subscription fees can be set proportional

to

approximation is tight in the sense that it cannot be improved more than

time.

After all, modeling bundling and subscriptions is computationally chal-

22

lenging due to the combinatorial nature. Dynamic pricing bundles and subscriptions, such as promotions and coupons, have rarely been touched yet.
4.3 Auctions
Auctions have a long history back to the Babylonian and Roman empires [185]. There are many excellent surveys on auctions (e.g., [24, 68, 118, 145]). A comprehensive review on auctions is far beyond the scope and capacity of this article. In this article, we instead only focus on the important role of auctions as a pricing mechanism for digital products.
4.3.1 Basics about Auctions
There are four basic types of auctions widely used.
• In the ascending-bid auction (also known as English auction), the price is raised successively until only one bidder remains, who wins the object at the ﬁnal price.
• The descending auction (also known as the Dutch auction) works the other way by starting at a very high price and lowering the price continuously, until the ﬁrst bidder calls out and accepts the current price.
• In the ﬁrst-price sealed-bid auction, every bidder submits a bid without knowing the others’ bids. The one making the highest bid wins and pays at the named price.
• The second-price sealed-bid auction (also known as the Vickrey auction [198]) works in the same way as the ﬁrst-price sealed-bid auction does, except that the winner pays only the second highest bid.
There are two basic models of the value information in auctions. The private-value model assumes that every bidder has an independent value on the object for sale. The value is also private to the bidder only. The pure common-value model assumes that the actual value of the object for sale is the same for all bidders, but bidders have diﬀerent private information about that actual value. Every bidder adjusts her/his estimate of the actual
23

value by learning other bidders’ signals. There are also models considering both values private to individual bidders and common to all bidders.
One fundamental principle in auction theory is the revenue equivalence theorem [152, 177, 198, 199], which essentially states that, for a set of riskneutral bidders with independent private valuation of an object drawn from a common cumulative distribution that is strictly increasing and atomless on [vmin, vmax], any auction mechanism yields the same expected revenue and thus any bidder with valuation v makes the same expected payment if (1) the object is allocated to the bidder with the highest valuation; and (2) any bidder with valuation vmin has an expected utility of 0. Based on the revenue equivalence theorem, the four basic types of auctions lead to the same payment by the winner and the same revenue.
While most studies in auction theory make some simple assumptions about independence of customer valuations, empirical studies [106] demonstrate that, in practice, the wrong assumption of valuation independence causes ineﬃcient auctions in e-commerce.
4.3.2 Sponsored Search Auctions
Online ad and sponsored search auctions [126, 172, 197] are one important application of auctions in pricing digital products. Sponsored search [110] is the business model where content providers pay search engines for traﬃc to their websites. In sponsored search, advertisers and, more generally, content providers bid for keywords in search engines, and search engines decide which ad to display in which position to answer a query from a user. GoTo.com created the ﬁrst sponsored search auction [110].
Diﬀerent pricing models can be used in sponsored search auctions, such as pay-per mille4/pay-per impression (PPM), pay-per-click (PPC), and payper-action (PPA). In the early days of sponsored search, a generalized ﬁrst price auction is used. Each advertiser bids on multiple keywords, and can set a bidding price for each keyword. When a user query is answered, which is a keyword, the top k bids on the keyword in price are displayed. If an ad is clicked by the user, the corresponding advertiser pays the bidding price. The ﬁrst price auction mechanism is unstable, costs advertisers time and reduces search engine proﬁts [64]. Later, Google generalizes the second
4That is, the cost of 1,000 advertisement impressions.
24

price auction mechanism [65], and enhances the ranking of bids by additional information, such as the ad’s click-through-rate (CTR), keyword relevance, and ad’s landing-page/site quality.
There are many in depth analyses about sponsored search auction mechanisms (e.g., [172]). For example, some studies analyze auction mechanisms based on assumptions about rationality, budget constraints and CTR distributions. Some other studies look at practical sponsored search systems and discuss auction mechanisms when the standard assumptions do not hold. Another group of studies, such as [22,43,53,80], conduct empirical studies to understand bidding behavior and statics. Last and latest, deep learning approaches are used to develop auction strategies in sponsored search [175,222].
4.3.3 Auctions on Digital Products with Unlimited Supplies
One unique feature of digital products is that the replication costs are very low and thus may have almost unlimited supply. Products of unlimited supplies lead to new challenges and opportunities to auction mechanism design. For example, the second price auction can be straightforwardly generalized for k identical products – the top k highest bidders win and each pays the (k + 1)-th bidding price. However, when there are unlimited identical products, the (k + 1)-th bidding price approaches 0. The lack of competition due to obsessive supplies prevents bidders from oﬀering any high prices. In other words, the challenge is how to ensure the bids are truthful, that is, reﬂecting the bidders’ true valuation of the digital products.
Denote by B the set of bidders, and by b1, b2, . . . the bidding prices in descending order, that is, bi ≥ bi+1 ≥ 0 for any i > 0. Suppose the generalized second price auction mechanism is used. That is, if k bids are taken, those winning bidders each pays the cost bk+1. The auction objective is to maximize k · bk+1. An auction is competitive if it yields revenue within a constant factor of the optimal ﬁxed pricing. It is tricky that, when there is unlimited supply, the Vickrey auction is not competitive if the seller chooses the number of products to sell before knowing the bids, and is not truthful if the seller chooses after knowing the bids [92].
Goldberg et al. [92] propose the ﬁrst competitive auction for digital goods with unlimited supplies. The major idea is the smart framework of random sampling auction. An auction is bid-independent if bidder i’s bid value should only determine whether the bidder wins the auction, but not the
25

price. We select a sample B of B at random, independent from the bid values. We use the bids in B to compute the optimal bid threshold fB that maximizes the revenue in B , and every bidder in B − B whose bid value is over fB wins. Symmetrically, we use the bids in B − B to compute the optimal bid threshold fB−B that maximizes the revenue in B − B , and every bidder in B whose bid value is higher than fB−B wins. In general, fB = fB−B does not necessarily hold. Random sampling auctions are competitive, no matter the single-price version or the multi-price version. Indeed, random sampling auctions are 15-competitive in the worst case [70] and 4-competitive for a large class of instances where there are at least 6 bids that are as good as the optimal sale price [14]. There are a series of improvements on random sampling auctions. For example, Hartline and McGrew [102] further improve the competitiveness.
Goldberg and Hartline [89] extend the scope from single digital product with unlimited supply to multiple products with unlimited supplies. Given a set of bids, they show that the bidder-optimal product assignment given the bids and the optimal sale prices can be determined by solving the integer programming problem as follows.

max subject to

j i xij rj

rm = 0

j xij ≤ 1

1≤i≤n

(3)

xij ≥ 0

1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m

pi + rj ≥ aij

1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m

i pi = j i xij (aij − rj )

where xij is the assignment of product j to bidder i, rj is the optimal price for product j, pi is the proﬁt of bidder i, and aij is bid from bidder i on product j.
Then, we can solve the optimal pricing problem in the following random sampling auction. Let B be the set of bidders. First, we obtain a sample B of bidders. Second, we compute the optimal sale prices for B . Last, we run the ﬁxed-price auction on B − B using the sale prices computed in Equation 3. All bidders in B lose the auction. The random sampling auction is shown truthful and competitive [89].
Most of the proposed auctions for digital goods with unlimited supply are randomized auctions. Goldberg et al. [92] show that no deterministic

26

auction can be competitive. Aggarwal et al. [9] later point out that the result does not hold for asymmetric auctions [144]. In a symmetric ex ante auction, buyers’ preference parameters are drawn from a symmetric probability distribution, and thus there exists a symmetric equilibrium if an equilibrium exists at all. In an asymmetric auction, each buyer has the same information about the product but a diﬀerent opportunity cost of obtaining the product, that is, bidders’ valuations are drawn from diﬀerent distributions. Aggarwal et al. [9] give an asymmetric deterministic auction that can approximate the revenue of any optimal single-price sale in the worst case. Indeed, they develop a general derandomization technique to transform any randomized auction into an asymmetric deterministic auction with approximately the same revenue. The general idea follows the deterministic maximum ﬂow solution to the well-known hat problem [63].
4.3.4 Envy-free Auctions
One drawback in random sampling auctions is that some bidders may lose even they make bids higher than some winning bidders do, since the bidders in B and B − B use diﬀerent thresholds (i.e., fB−B and fB , respectively) in the one product version and all bidders in B lose in the multiple product version.
Goldberg and Hartline [91] establish a fundamental result: an auction cannot be truthful, competitive and envy-free at the same time. They also explore possible tradeoﬀs between truthfulness and envy-freeness based on the consensus revenue estimate (CORE) technique [90]. Speciﬁcally, using a similar idea in combinatorial auctions with single parameter agents [16], we can relax the truthfulness requirement by requiring being truthful with probability (1− ), and always guarantee envy-free. The auction is highly truthful when approaches 0 and the number of winners in the auction approaches inﬁnity. The other type of auctions relaxes the envy-free requirement to being envy-free with probability (1 − ), and guarantees truthfulness. Both auctions are competitive and the probability is over random coin tosses made by the randomized auction mechanism and not the input.
27

4.3.5 Online Auctions

In addition to potentially unlimited supply, another important feature of

digital goods is that a digital good may be sold repetitively, such as a movie

and a song. Therefore, auctions on digital goods may run continuously

instead of only one round. Moreover, customers may want to have prompt

answers to their bids.

Online auctions [129] are designed to address the setting where diﬀer-

ent customers bid at diﬀerent times. The auction mechanism has to make

decision about each bid as it arrives. An (online) auction is incentive com-

patible if the bidders are rationally motivated to reveal their true valuations

of the object. Lavi and Nisan [129] show that an online auction is incentive

compatible if and only if it is based on supply curves under the assumption

of limited supply, that is, before it receives the i-th bid bi(q), it ﬁxes the

supply curve pi(q) based on the previous bids, and (1) the quantity qi sold

to customer i is the quantity q that maximizes the sum

q j=1

(bi

(j)

−

pi(j));

and (2) the price paid by i is

q j=1

pi(j

).

To tackle the challenges when there is unlimited supply, Bar-Yossef

et al. [31] point out that supply curves are not available anymore. Instead,

they propose an extremely simple incentive-compatible randomized online

auction. Each bidder i picks a random number t ∈ {0, . . . , log h } and sets

the price threshold to si = 2t, where h is the ratio of the highest valuation against the lowest valuation among all bidders. This auction is O(log h)-

competitive.

The auction mechanism can be further improved to achieve even bet-

ter incentive-compatibility. Speciﬁcally, we can divide a sequence of bids

b1, b2, . . . into l = ( log h + 1) buckets, such that bucket Bj contains the bids with indexes in range [2j, 2j+1). The weight of bucket Bj is the sum of
bids within Bj, that is, wj = i∈Bj i. A new bidder can choose one of the buckets at random with the probability proportional to the bucket weight,

and pays the price of the lowest bid of the bucket. The price si that bidder

i pays follows the probability distribution P r[si = 2j] =

4.4 Summary
As revenue maximization plays a fundamental role in pricing digital products, we review the three major streams of revenues for digital products, namely money, information/privacy, and time/attention. Then, we revisit bundling and subscription planning for digital products, which echoes the opportunities and challenges due to low replication costs of information goods. Auctions are widely used in pricing digital products. We review some basic types of auctions and their applications in digital products, including sponsored search auctions, auctions with unlimited supplies, envy-free auctions and online auctions. Some ideas employed by pricing digital products are also used in pricing data products, as to be discussed in the next section.
5 Pricing Data Products
In this section, we discuss pricing in marketplaces of data. We ﬁrst obtain an overall understanding about data markets and the major players in such markets. Then, we look into several most studied technical problems in data product pricing, including arbitrage-free pricing, revenue maximization pricing, fair and truthful pricing and privacy preservation in data marketplaces. Last, we discuss pricing in novel application scenarios, including dynamic data pricing, online pricing and federated learning pricing.
5.1 Data Markets and Pricing, What Are They?
Marketplaces for data have been actively developed for over a decade. An early survey [179] identiﬁes diﬀerent categories and dimensions of data marketplaces and data vendors in 2012. There are many studies on various issues about data markets and pricing strategies. Before we discuss any speciﬁcs in detail, it is important to obtain an overall understanding about data markets, such as what are sold and for what purposes, who are the sellers, who are the buyers, and what are the basic pricing models.
Pantelis and Aija [167] present a brief economic analysis of data taxonomy as a market mechanism. Data and databases are legally protected by either copyright or database right. Copyright protects expression and significant creative eﬀort that creates and organizes data. Database right protects
29

a whole database. One challenge is that both copyright and database right are hard to enforce due to the non-rivalrous nature of data.
In general, data may be owned by governments, private parties or individuals. Consequently, data can be categorized into three types: open, public, and private data [167]. Open data are common pool resources [166], such as the data made available by the open data initiatives. Public data, such as the data collected by the government in the United States, are valuable resources subject to the “tragedy of the commons” [101]. Public data are often produced by individuals or organizations for research and used by governments and local authorities, but may also be employed by commercial parties to enhance their proprietary resources or services. Private data are generated by private applications or services.
To understand what are sold in data markets and for what purposes, Muschalle et al. [151] consider the common queries and demands on data markets, as well as the pricing strategies. They observe two major types of queries. The ﬁrst type of queries is to estimate the value of a “thing” or compare the values of “things”, where examples of the “things” are like webpages for advertisements, starlets, politicians and products. The second type is to show all about a “thing”. Those queries are raised by seven categories of beneﬁciaries, namely analysts, application vendors, data processing algorithm developers, data providers, consultants, licensing and certiﬁcation entities, and data market owners. Muschalle et al. [151] also identify three types of market structures. First, in a monopoly, a supplier is powerful enough to set prices to maximize proﬁts. Second, an oligopoly is dominated by a small number of strong competitors. Last, in strong competition markets, prices may align with marginal costs.
A series of pricing strategies and models may be considered in data markets [151]. First, free data may be obtained from public authorities, may help to attract customers and suppliers of commercial data, and may be integrated into private and not-free data products. Second, prices can be based on usages, such as charging customers per hour of data usage. Third, package pricing allows a customer to obtain a certain amount of data or API calls for a ﬁxed fee. A few studies [116, 210] try to optimize package pricing models. Fourth, in the ﬂat fee tariﬀ model, a data product or service is oﬀered at a ﬂat rate, regardless of usage. It is simple, easy to use. The drawback is the lack of ﬂexibility, particularly for buyers. Fifth,
30

combining package pricing and ﬂat fee tariﬀ results in two-part tariﬀ, that is, a ﬁxed basic fee plus additional fee per unit consumed. This model is popular in data services. Speciﬁcally, Wu and Banker [209] show that, under zero marginal costs and monitoring costs, ﬂat fee and two-part tariﬀ pricing are on par, and two-part tariﬀ is the most proﬁtable strategy. Last, in the freemium model, users can use basic products or services for free and pay for premium functions or services.
Recently, machine learning, particularly deep learning [94], becomes disruptive in many applications, such as computer vision [139,201] and natural language processing [218]. In most situations, powerful deep models heavily rely on large amounts of training data [156]. Monetization of data and machine learning models built on data through markets gains stronger and stronger interests from industry. Speciﬁc to data as an economic good and data pricing as a monetization mechanism in this context, a series of studies focus on data utility for model building and the associated pricing, particularly considering privacy.
Some data owners may have detailed knowledge of speciﬁc machine learning tasks and thus dedicate corresponding eﬀort to collect high quality data for building better models. Babaioﬀ et al. [23] study the design of optimal mechanisms for a monopoly data provider to sell her/his data. Speciﬁcally, they show that it is feasible to achieve optimal revenue by a simple one-round protocol, that is, a protocol where a buyer and a seller each sends a single message, and there is a single money transfer. The optimal mechanism can be computed in polynomial time. For a buyer who may abort the interaction with a seller prematurely, multiple rounds of partial information disclosure interleaved by payments may be needed to ensure optimal revenue. Cummings et al. [49] study the optimal design for data buyers to purchase data estimators with diﬀerent variances and combine the estimators to meet a required quality guarantee on variance with the lowest total cost.
The role of privacy in data collection and machine learning model building is investigated. For example, Ghosh and Roth [87] develop auctions that are truthful and approximately optimal for data buyers to obtain accurate estimates on data from owners who are compensated for privacy loss. They show that the classic Vickrey auction [198] can minimize the buyer’s total payment and meet the accuracy requirement. They also develop a mechanism that can maximize the accuracy given a budget.
31

In general, modeling data owners’ costs of privacy loss is very diﬃcult, since the costs may be correlated with private data arbitrarily. It is impossible to design a direct revelation mechanism that can provide a non-trivial guarantee on accuracy and, at the same time, is rational for individual data owners. To tackle the issue, Ligett and Roth [137] design a take-it-or-leaveit mechanism, which randomly approaches individuals from a population and makes oﬀers. This mechanism can be used for some data collection scenarios, such as surveys.
Versioning is an important strategy in data pricing. A data seller can customize data into diﬀerent versions according to buyers’ needs. Bergemann et al. [34] develop the optimal menu of information products that a monopoly data supplier can oﬀer to a data buyer, so that one product can ﬁt the buyer’s willingness to buy the information at the oﬀered price, and the revenue is maximized. One important ﬁnding is that information products indeed allow larger scopes of price discrimination. There are at least two dimensions that sellers can explore to derive various subsets of a data set, namely data quality and data position.
When data are used to build machine learning models, it is important to assess the value of each data record within a data set. There exist various methods for assessment, such as leave-one-out [47], leverage or inﬂuence score [48].
Ghorbani and Zou [85] propose to apply the Shapley fairness on the data used to train a machine learning model, and thus deﬁne data Shapley for a record i in a training data set D as

ψi = C

U(S ∪ {i}) − U(S)
n−1

S⊆D−{i}

|S|

where C is an arbitrary (positive) constant, and U(S) is the performance score of the model trained on data S ⊆ D. One challenge is that computing the exact data Shapley values on large data sets for sophisticated models, such as deep neural networks, is computational prohibitive. Ghorbani and Zou [85] also develop Monte Carlo and gradient-based methods for estimation.
If a data point p appears in two samples D1 and D2 from the same data distribution, intuitively the Shapley value of p in D1 and D2 should be similar. Mathematically, the intrinsic Shapley value of p in a distribution should

32

be the expectation of the Shapley value of p in the distribution. Based on this intuition, Ghorbani et al. [84] propose the notion of distributional Shapley. Let Z be a universe in question. For example, in classiﬁcation problems, conventionally Z = X ×Y, where X is the feature space and Y is the output. Let D be a data distribution in Z. Assuming a potential function or a performance metric U : Z∗ → [0, 1] and a sample size m > 0, the distributional Shapley value of a point z ∈ Z is the expected Shapley value over data sets of size m containing z, that is, ν(z; U, D, m) = ES∼Dm−1[ψ(z; U, S ∪ {z}], where S ∼ Dm−1 is a set of m points sampled i.i.d. from D. They show that distribution Shapley values are stable. Kwon et al. [125] further derive the computationally tractable expressions for distributional Shapley for a series of models, including linear regression, binary classiﬁcation and nonparametric density estimation.
Alternative to Shapley values, there are some other data valuation methods. For example, in machine learning, inﬂuence functions [119,206] approximate leave-one-out to assess the value of a data item. Cai et al. [41] propose strategy-proof mechanisms for data elicitation and trade oﬀ between model accuracy and reward. Richardson et al. [176] focus on the case of linear regression. Recently, Yoon et al. [217] propose data valuation using reinforcement learning. They use a data value estimator to learn how much a data item as an element in the training data contributes to improving model performance. One distinct advantage is that the model being trained and the data value estimator can improve each other’s performance.
Data quality is an important issue [170]. There are many studies on assessment of data quality [103, 170, 204]. Some studies speciﬁcally focus on pricing based on data quality and the impact on data markets. Heckman et al. [103] propose a simple linear model,
Value of data = ﬁxed cost + wi · factori,
i
where the factors include but are not limited to age of data, periodicity of data, volume of data, and accuracy of data, and wi is the associated weight. One practical diﬃculty in using the model is that the parameters in the model are hard to estimate. Another diﬃculty is that many data sets do not have public prices associated. Yu and Zhang [219] consider pricing multiple versions formed by multiple factors of data quality and build a two-level model. The ﬁrst level is the data platform where a single owner
33

is assumed, who designs the number of versions. The second level is the customers who want to maximize the data utility. Each level is modeled as a maximization problem and thus the whole model is a bi-level programming problem, which is NP-hard.
Another way to form multiple versions of data products is to charge by queries [121–124]. Intuitively, a data seller may treat a view of a data set as a version. Setting the price for every possible view is not only tedious but also tricky. If prices on views are not set properly, arbitrages or less than highest prices may happen. Koutris et al. [121, 124] propose a framework of query and view based data pricing. The major idea is that a seller only needs to specify the prices on a few views, and then the prices of other views can be decided algorithmically. Their advocate two desiderata, arbitragefreeness and discount-freeness. Theoretically, they show the existence and uniqueness of pricing functions satisfying the requirements. They also show the complexity of computing the pricing functions. Unfortunately, only selection views and conjunctive queries without self-joins are tractable. They present polynomial time algorithms for chain queries and cyclic queries.
Technically, the core idea in the view and query based pricing framework is query determinacy [157, 158, 180]. A query Q is said to be determined by a set of views V if the answer to Q can be completely derived from the views. Query determinacy enables the feasibility of arbitrage detection. If V determines Q, then arbitrage happens if and only if the price of V is cheaper than that of Q.
Koutris et al. [123] further explore the technical challenges in practical implementation of view and query based data pricing. Speciﬁcally, they develop an integer linear programming formulation for the pricing problem with a large number of queries. Considering the scenario where a user may purchase multiple queries over time or the database is updated, such that information in multiple queries and updates may have overlaps, they also leverage query history to avoid double charging. To handle the situation where there are multiple sellers, they deﬁne the share of a seller as the maximum revenue that the seller can get among all minimum-cost solutions, and accordingly deﬁne a fair revenue distribution policy. A prototype demonstration system is reported in [122].
Tang et al. [192] follow the view and query based pricing framework and consider the minimum granularity of data, that is, each tuple is a view.
34

Their model assigns to each tuple a price and prices queries based on minimal provenances. Tang et al. [191] extend view and query based pricing to XML documents and consider the situation where a customer may just want to purchase a sample instead of the complete query result.

5.2 Arbitrage-free Pricing

Arbitrage is probably the most intensively studied issue in pricing data prod-

ucts. As introduced in Section 3.2.4, in general, arbitrage is the activities

that take advantage of price diﬀerences between two or more markets or

channels. Arbitrage is undesirable in many pricing models. Unfortunately,

arbitrage may sneak in pricing models without rigorous design. For exam-

ple, Balazinska et al. [28] analyze that subscription based pricing possibly

with a query limit allows arbitrage. Muschalle et al. [151] point out that a

pricing model charging users a certain amount of API calls for a ﬁxed rate

may potentially allow arbitrage, depending on the package size.

Arbitrage-freeness is one of the fundamental properties of pricing mod-

els in query and view based pricing [121–124]. Li and Miklau [134] and

Li et al. [133] develop frameworks of pricing linear aggregate queries. Specif-

ically, Li et al. [133] consider linear queries. Given a data set of n tuples

x1, . . . , xn, a linear query q = (q1, . . . , qN ) is a real-valued vector, and the

answer q(x) =

n i=1

qixi.

For

a

multiset

of

queries

S = {Q1, . . . , Qk}

and

query Q, if the answer to Q can be linearly derived from the answers to the

queries in S, then Q is said to be determined by S, denoted by S → Q. A

pricing function π(Q) is arbitrage-free if for any multiset S and query Q

such that S → Q, π(Q) ≤

k i=1

π(Qi).

Under the general intuition of arbitrage-freeness, Li et al. [133] consider

a speciﬁc form of queries, linear queries with variance (q, v), that is, the

estimation of the answer to query q should have a variance no larger than v.

Using diﬀerent values of v, diﬀerent versions are formed. A pricing model

not carefully designed may allow arbitrage.

35

f (π1(q), . . . , πk(q)) is also arbitrage-free if f is a subadditive6 and nondecreasing function.
As Roth [178] summarizes, the framework by Li et al. [133] still faces three important challenges. First, arbitrage is still possible to derive answers to a bundle of queries from another bundle of queries and their answers. Second, arbitrage is still possible on biased estimators for statistical queries. Last, it is unclear whether we can obtain arbitrage-free pricing maximizing proﬁt given the distribution of buyer demands. Later, Deep and Koutris [54] provide some interesting insights to arbitrage-free pricing for bundles.
Lin and Kifer [138] investigate arbitrage-free pricing for general data queries. They consider three types of pricing models for query bundles, where a query bundle is a set of queries posted simultaneously as a batch. First, an instance-independent pricing function depends on the query bundle but not the database instance. Second, an up-front dependent pricing function depends on both the query bundle and the database instance. A customer knows an un-front dependent pricing function, and decides whether to purchase or not the query answers. Last, a delayed pricing function depends on both the query bundle and the answers computed by the query bundle on the current database instance. The customer knows the pricing function, but do not know the exact price. Once agreeing, the customer is charged when the answers are computed.
Lin and Kifer [138] also summarize ﬁve diﬀerent types of arbitrage situations. First, if prices are quoted by queries, in order to avoid price-based arbitrage, answers to queries should not be deduced from prices along. Second, a buyer may use multiple accounts to derive answers to a query bundle. To avoid separate account arbitrage, the price of a query bundle [q1, q2] should be at most the sum of the prices of q1 and q2. Third, if the answers to a query bundle q can always be deduced from answers to another query bundle q, to prevent post-processing arbitrage from happening, the price of q should be no cheaper than that of q . Fourth, although the answers to a query bundle q may not be always derivable from the answers to another query bundle q on all database instances, still for a speciﬁc database instance I, the answers to q may be derived from the answers to q . If so, a serendipitous arbitrage happens. Last, if two queries behave almost identical but their prices are dramatically diﬀerent, almost-certain arbitrage

happens. Based on the above categorization, they discuss conditions that can prevent various types of arbitrage situations from happening.
Pricing many queries in real time with formal guarantees on arbitrage freeness is challenging. Many theoretical methods are not scalable in practice. For example, it takes QueryMarket [123] about one minute to compute the price of a join query over a relation of about 1000 tuples. Qirana [55,56] is a system for query-based pricing. The system allows data sellers to choose from a set of pricing functions that are information arbitrage-free, which covers both post-processing arbitrage-freeness and serendipitous arbitragefreeness in Lin and Kifer’s taxonomy [138]. Qirana also supports historyaware pricing. Qirana has been shown highly eﬃcient and scalable on TPCH7 and SSB8 benchmark datasets as demonstration.
The key idea in Qirana is that it regards a query as an uncertainty reduction mechanism. Initially, a buyer faces a set of possible databases I deﬁned by a database schema, primary keys and predeﬁned constraints. Once a buyer obtains the answer E to a query Q, all possible databases D such that E = Q(D) are eliminated. The price assigned to Q should be a function of how much the set of possible databases shrinks. Let S be the set of possible databases before the query Q is answered. S is called the support set. Then, a weighted coverage function assigns a weight wi to every Di ∈ S, and computes the price to a query by pwc(Q, D) = Q(Di)=Q(D) wi. Alternatively, consider the equivalence relation in S: Di ∼ Dj if and only if Q(Di) = Q(Dj). Assign to each possible database Di ∈ S a weight wi such that Di∈S wi = 1. Let PQ be the set of equivalence classes. For each class B ∈ PQ, denote by wB = Di∈B wi. The Shannon entropy function is used to compute the price of query Q as the entropy of the query output P H (Q, D) = − B∈PQ wB log wB. The q-entropy function (also known as Tsallis entropy) for q = 2 is used to assign to Q the price P T (Q, D) = B∈PQ wB(1 − wB). Deep and Koutris [54] show that the weighted coverage function, the Shannon entropy function and the 2-entropy function are all arbitrage-free.
Using the complete set of possible databases as the support set leads to a #P -hard problem. To make the price calculation computationally feasible, Qirana uses uniform random sample and random neighboors as the support

sets. In targeted advertising markets, user data, such as opt-in email ad-
dresses, and user impressions are sold as data products. How to price users9 properly to avoid arbitrage is important. Xia and Muthukrishnan [213] consider the following problem. Denote by qi a selection query over user attributes, by Ui the set of all users satisfying qi, and by pi the price of each user in Ui. If a buyer purchases n users (1 ≤ n ≤ |Ui|) in Ui, she/he has to pay n · pi. If prices of diﬀerent queries are not well coordinated, version-arbitrage may arise. If two queries qi and qj return similar user sets but qi is dramatically more expensive than qj, then a user who wants qi may purchase qj instead. Xia and Muthukrishnan [213] point out that uniform pricing, that is, every query has the same price, is arbitrage-free, but is a logarithmic approximation to the maximum revenue arbitrage-free pricing solution. Then, they present a greedy non-uniform pricing design. The design starts with the optimal uniform pricing that is arbitrage-free, and then iteratively updates the pricing function. If the price of a query can be updated to increase the revenue, it is increased so that the arbitrage-free property is retained. This greedy algorithm is still a logarithmic approximation to the maximum revenue arbitrage-free pricing solution.
Chen et al. [44] develop an arbitrage-free pricing design for multiple versions of a machine learning model. They assume that a broker trains the optimal model on the complete raw data. Then, random Gaussian noises are added to the optimal model to produce diﬀerent versions for diﬀerent buyers. The assumption is that the error of a machine learning model instance is monotonic with respect to the variance of the noise injected into the model. In this setting, a pricing function is arbitrage-free if and only if the price of a randomized model instance is monotonically increasing and subadditive with respect to the inverse of the variance.
5.3 Revenue Maximization Pricing
As explained in Section 3.2.2, the objective of revenue maximization is often of special interest in designing pricing strategies, since for a business to be successful long term, a more immediate and important requirement is to win

38

over as many customers as possible.

Revenue maximization pricing for data products is a relatively less ex-

plored area. A possible reason is that, comparing with pricing digital prod-

ucts, some other factors in pricing data products need more urgent accom-

modation, such as arbitrage.

As mentioned in Section 5.2, Xia and Muthukrishnan [213] develop loga-

rithmic approximation pricing algorithms for revenue maximization in user-

based markets. They also consider the situations where both the maximum

number (i.e., maximum demand) and the minimum number (i.e., minimum

demand) of users that a buyer purchases are speciﬁed, and provide an O(D)

approximation algorithm to maximize revenue, where D is the largest min-

imal demand among all buyers.

Chawla et al. [42] consider query and view based pricing for arbitrage-

free revenue maximization under the assumption that all buyers are single-

minded and the supply is unlimited. A buyer is single-minded if the buyer

wants to purchase the answer to a single set of queries. They consider three

types of pricing functions. Uniform bundle pricing sets the price of every

bundle identical. Additive or item pricing prices each item and charges a

bundle the sum of prices for the items in the bundle. Fractionally subadditive

pricing or XOS sets k weights wj1, . . . , wjk for each item j, and for a bundle e, the price is set to maxki=1 j∈e wji . Building on the extensive studies on
revenue maximization with single-minded buyers and unlimited supply [29,

39, 96], they develop new heuristics.

It is well known that there exists uniform bundle pricing that is O(log m)

approximation of revenue maximization, where m is the number of bundles.

Swamy and Cheung [189] show that item pricing can achieve an O(log B)

approximation of maximum revenue, where B is the maximum number of

bundles an item can involve. Chawla et al. [42] show some new lower bounds,

that is, uniform bundle pricing, item pricing and XOS pricing combining

a constant number of item pricing functions are still Ω(log m) away from

maximum revenue. They also present approximation algorithms.

To maximize revenue in machine learning models, Chen et al. [44] show

that the optimization problem is coNP-hard. Thus, they relax the subaddi-

tive

constraint

5.4 Fair and Truthful Pricing
Fairness and truthfulness are important for data product markets. Recall that fairness refers to that the revenue generated by a sale transaction in the data market is distributed among sellers in an unprejudiced manner so that they are paid for their marginal contributions. Truthfulness means a market where buyers are well motivated to report their internal valuations of data products unwarily.
Agarwal et al. [7] propose a mathematical model of data marketplaces that are fair, truthful, revenue maximizing, and scalable. They assume each seller j supplies a data stream Xj and each buyer n conducts a prediction task Yn, where Xj, Yn ∈ RT . For example, Xj may be a stream of customers’ interest on diﬀerent products, and Yn is a task predicting a new customer’s interest. Taking a prediction task Yn and an estimate Yˆn, a prediction gain function Gn : R2T → [0, 1] measures the quality of the prediction. The value that buyer n gets from estimate Yˆn is µn·G(Yn, Yˆn), where µn is the price rate that the buyer is willing to pay for a unit increase in G. A machine learning model M : RMT → RT uses data from M sellers to produce an estimate Yn for buyer n’s prediction task Yn. Let pn and bn be the price and the bid, respectively. Then, allocation function AF : (pn, bn; XM ) → XM measures the quality at which buyer n obtains that is allocated to the sellers on sale XM , where XM ∈ RM . Revenue function RF : (pn, bn, Yn; M, G, XM ) → rn calculates how much revenue rn ∈ R+ to extract from the buyer. The utility that buyer n receives by bidding nn for Yn is
U (bn, Yn) = µn · G(Yn, Yˆn) − RF (pn, bn, Yn),
where Yˆn = M(Yn, XM ) and XM = AF (pn, bn; XM ). A market is truthful if for all prediction tasks Yn, µn = arg maxz∈R+ U (z, Yn). They adopt the notion of fairness following the famous Shapley fairness [184].
One main result [7] is that, the data market deﬁned as such is truthful if and only if function AF∗ is monotonic, that is, an increase in the diﬀerence

40

between price rate pn and bid bn leads to a decrease in predication gain G.
They also give randomized -approximation algorithms for fair data market, that is, ||ψn,Shapley − ψˆn||∞ < with probability 1 − δ, where ψn,Shapley is the Shapley-fair payment division among sellers, ψˆn is the output of the

approximation algorithm, and δ, > 0. Their algorithms are polynomial.

Shapley fairness [184] is popularly adopted as the foundation of fairness

in data markets. However, computing Shapley value is exponential [57].

Maleki et al. [141] present a permutation sampling method that approxi-

mates Shapley values for any bounded utility functions. The basic idea is to

use Equation 2 and tackle ψ(s) = E[U (Psπ ∪ {s}) − U (Piπ)] by sample mean.

Following Hoeﬀding’s inequality [104], to achieve an ( , δ)-approximation,

that is, P (|sˆ− s|p ≤

1 − δ,

we

need

samples and evaluate the utility function O(N 2 log N ) times, where r is the

range of the utility function U.

Jia et al. [112] present approximation algorithms for Shapley value that

can substantially reduce the number of times that the utility function is

evaluated. First, they apply the idea of feature selection using group test-

ing [60, 225]. For user s, let βs be the random variable that s appears in a random sample of sellers. Then, for sellers si and sj, the diﬀerence in

Shapley values between si and sj is

ψ(si) − ψ(sj)

=

1 N −1

U (S∪{si})−U (S∪{sj })

S∈D\{si,sj }

( ) N−2 |S|

= E[(βsi − βsj )U (βs1 , . . . , βsj )]

where U (βs1, . . . , βsj ) is the utility computed using the sellers appearing in the random sample. They can use group testing to ﬁrst estimate the Shapley diﬀerences and then derive the Shapley value from the diﬀerences by solving a feasibility problem. They show that this algorith√m is an ( , δ)-approximation that evaluates the utility function at most O( N (log N )2) times. They further observe that most of the Shapley values are around the mean. Exploiting this approximate sparsity, they give an ( , δ)-approximation algorithm that evaluates the utility function only O(N (log N ) log(log N ) times.
Ghorbani and Zou [85] propose a principled framework of fair data evaluation in supervised learning, and Monte-Carlo and gradient-based approximation methods. Their Monte-Carlo method follows a general idea similar to that in Jia et al. [112]. They generate Monte-Carlo estimates until the

41

average empirically converges. They also argue that, in practice, it is suﬃ-

cient to estimate Shapley values up to the intrinsic noise in the predictive

performance on the test data set. Adding one tuple as a training data point

does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the performance of a model trained using a large

training data set. Therefore, truncation can be used in practice based on the

bootstrap variation on the test set. In their gradient Shapley method, they

train a model using one “epoch” of the training data, and then update the

model by gradient descent on one data point at a time, where the marginal

contribution is the change in the performance of the model.

In general, computing Shapley values requires an exponential number

of model evaluations. However, for some speciﬁc model, the computation

may be reduced dramatically. For example, Jia et al. [111] show that for

unweighted kNN classiﬁers, the exact computation needs only O(N log N ) time and an ( , δ)-approximation can be achieved in O(N h( ,k) log N ) time

when is not too small and k is not too large. They also propose a Monte-

Carlo

approximation

of

O(

N (log N )2 (log k)2

)

for

weighted

kNN

classiﬁers.

A key

enabler of the progress is the speciﬁc utility function of a kNN classiﬁer

min{k,|S|}

1

UkNN (S) = k

1[yαi(S) = ytest]

i=1

where αi(S) is the index of the training feature that is the k-th closest to xtest among the training examples in S. Moreover, the sublinear approximation for unweighted kNN classiﬁers is facilitated by locality sensitive hashing [52].
Recently, Jia et al. [113] leverage the eﬃcient computation of Shapley values in kNN [111] to tackle general classiﬁcation problems. They propose to ﬁrst train a target model, such as a deep neural network, and identify the features. Then, they conduct a model distillation to kNN by training a kNN classiﬁer using the features to mimic the performance of the original model and tune parameter k, the number of nearest neighbors considered. Last, they apply the Shapley value estimation method in kNN [111] to approach the Shapley values in the target model.
Many classic rewarding methods, such as Shapley values, may be vulnerable to data-replication attacks. One data provider may replicate its data and act as an additional provider to obtain extra unconscionable rewards. To prevent data-replication attacks from happening, replication-robust payoﬀ mechanisms are proposed. Han et al. [100] propose a ﬁx to Shapley value

42

based payoﬀ mechanisms. The idea is to down-weigh the Shapley value – a data provider gets a less reward if there are multiple copies of its data in the coalitions.
Related to fairness and truthfulness in a market, cooperation among different agents in a market may happen. Building trust in a sub-community within a data marketplace becomes an interesting subject. Armstrong and Durfee [17] analyze factors that may inﬂuence the eﬃciency of building trust and conducting cooperation in a data market. For each agent in a market, the other agents can be divided into two categories, namely those remembered agents and those strange or forgotten agents. They have a few interesting ﬁndings. Cooperations arising from iterated interactions is inversely proportional to the rate of system mixing, the number of initially misbehaving agents, and the rate at which agents explore alternative strategies. Cooperation is also initially inversely proportional to population size. At the same time, cooperation is proportional to average member size and better estimation of the likelihood of strange agents to misbehave.
5.5 Privacy Preserving Marketplaces of Data
Privacy is a serious concern and also a critical tipping point in designing marketplaces of data. When a user shares her/his data with some others, the user may disclose her/his privacy to some extent. Therefore, it is important to explore how to protect or minimize the privacy leakage. At the same time, it is also important to understand how a seller’s privacy disclosure may be properly compensated through data pricing.
Ghosh and Roth [87] design truthful marketplaces where data buyers want to purchase data to estimate statistics and sellers want compensation for their privacy loss. In the design, there is only one query and the individual evaluations of their data are private. Data owners are asked to report the costs for the use of their data. Under the assumption of diﬀerential privacy [61, 62], they transform the problem into variants of multi-unit procurement auction. They show that, when a buyer holds an accuracy goal, the classic Vickrey auction can minimize the buyer’s total cost and guarantee the accuracy. When the buyer has a budget, they give an approximation algorithm to maximize the accuracy under the budget constraint.
The method by Ghosh and Roth [87] may not work well when the costs
43

and the data are correlated. For example, a store with more customer traﬃc may request a higher cost in using the data. Correspondingly, reporting the cost may reveal the privacy of the store. Fleischer and Lyu [74] tackle the scenario where costs are correlated with data and propose a postedprice-like mechanism. Given a set of data sellers categorized into diﬀerent types and the associated distributions of costs, the mechanism oﬀers each user a contract with the expected payment corresponding to the type. If a seller takes the oﬀer, the payment is determined by the seller’s veriﬁable type and the associated payment in the contract. All sellers have the same probability to take or reject their contracts independently. The sellers are truthful, that is, a user takes the oﬀer if the payment is larger than or equal to the privacy loss. This posted-price-like mechanism is Bayesian incentive compatible (i.e., every seller’s strategy is Bayesian-Nash equilibrium), exinterim individually rational (i.e., the expected utility is non-negative for every seller when the seller decides truthfully), O( −1)-accurate, perfectly data private (i.e., whenever the mechanism’s posterior belief about a seller’s data diﬀers from its prior belief, the mechanism pays the seller) and diﬀerentially private.
Li et al. [133] tackle the same problem as Ghosh and Roth [87] do, but assume that individual valuations are public and focus on returning unbiased estimations and pricing multiple queries consistently. To address the concerns on privacy loss, they develop a theoretical framework to divide the price among data owners who contribute to the aggregate computation and thus have loss of privacy. Their framework extends several principles from both diﬀerential privacy and query pricing in data markets.
The fairness mechanism considered by Li et al. [133] only compensates a seller whose data are used. Niu et al. [163] further consider the scenario where multiple sellers’ data are correlated and extend to dependent fairness. In dependent fairness, a seller s is still compensated if the data of another seller s are used that are correlated with the data of s. They propose two approaches to privacy compensation. In the bottom-up approach, the broker ﬁrst satisﬁes each individual seller’s privacy compensation and then decides the price for the statistic selling to a buyer. In the top-down design, the broker decides the total price of a data aggregate product sold to a buyer, and then spares a fraction of the total price for privacy compensation. The privacy compensation is divided and assigned to individual data
44

sellers by solving a budget allocation problem. Each seller receives a com-

pensation roughly proportional to the privacy loss due to the data sharing.

Niu et al. [161] further extend to time series data that may have temporal

correlations. They adopt Puﬀerﬁsh privacy [117] to measure privacy losses

under temporal correlations.

While various eﬀorts have been made to address the challenges of privacy

loss compensation when user data are correlated in one way or another, as

Ghosh and Roth [87] point out, in general, it is impossible for any mechanism

to compensate individuals for privacy loss properly if correlations between

their private data and their cost functions are unknown beforehand.

In the classical setting of physical goods [143], using contract theory [142]

with hidden information, that is, unobservable types of buyers, a seller can

design a set of contracts with diﬀerent consumption levels to maximize rev-

enue from buyers. Naghizadeh and Sinha [154] extend the contract design

model to price a bundle of queries at diﬀerent privacy levels to maximize

revenue. They also consider adversarial users. Their work also adopts dif-

ferential privacy [61, 62]. For a query bundle {Q1, . . . , Qk}, a contract is a

tuple (p, , s), where p > 0 is the price paid by a buyer, is the privacy

budget, such that a buyer can get an answer to query Qi (1 ≤ i ≤ k) with

i-diﬀerential privacy guarantee, and ≥

k i=1

i, and p is the post-hoc ﬁne

to be paid if the buyer is found misusing the query answers. It is assumed

that an adversarial buyer derives a beneﬁt C( ), which is monotonically

increasing and convex, C(0) = 0. One interesting ﬁnding is that, in the tra-

ditional contract theory, if there are n types of honest buyers and one type

of adversarial buyers, the seller should design up to n + 1 contracts. In the

data marketplace situation, they show that up to n contracts are suﬃcient.

In other words, a data seller should not design a contract for the adver-

sary. Instead, the seller should adjust the contracts’ pricing to account for

the risks from adversarial users. They also design post-hoc ﬁnes in pricing

query bundles that can help to reduce loss due to privacy leakage by adver-

sarial buyers. They provide a fast approximation algorithm to compute the

contracts.

A data owner has to decide a tradeoﬀ between privacy and data utility.

Li and Raghunathan [135] design an economics-based incentive-compatible

mechanism for a data owner to price and disseminate private data. Speciﬁ-

cally, let two-part tariﬀ pricing function R(s, x) = αs + βsx be the price for

45

x amount of data at sensitivity level s, where αs and βs are the ﬁxed and variable price factors, respectively. Assuming two types of data users, one type for aggregate information and patterns in data and the other type for individual identity and personal information, the proposed mechanism works in four stages. First, the data owner selects a variety of sensitivity types to oﬀer. Second, the data owner oﬀers diﬀerent prices for data with diﬀerent sensitivity types. Third, a data user selects a certain sensitivity type with corresponding price, and thus reveals the user type. Last, the data user selects the optimal amount of data with the chosen sensitivity type. The core idea is that the data owner can identify the sensitive attributes in the data, such as the identifying attributes, which are not useful for aggregate analysis but necessary at individual communication. A data owner can oﬀer a lower price for data without sensitive attributes, and charge for a higher price for data with sensitive attributes. This approach provides an orthogonal idea to the popular ways of tuning the parameter in diﬀerential privacy.
Due to the privacy concerns, when a company may have opportunities to collect data about its customers, should it do it (i.e., collecting and revealing the data) or not (i.e., a blanket policy of never collecting)? Jaisingh et al. [109] ﬁnd that the company should not collect customer data if the total gains from trading the data cannot cover the privacy loss. In practice, there is an increasing tendency for consumers to overestimate their loss of privacy, particularly when the use of the private data is uncertain. In other cases, the company should oﬀer two contracts on their services and products. One contract collects the customer data at a certain price, and the other contract does not collect any customer data at a diﬀerent price.
While most of the studies on privacy preserving data marketplaces focus on the privacy of data owners, transactions may also disclose privacy of data buyers, such as what, when and how much they buy. For example, a retail company purchasing query results may consider what queries (e.g., the products or customer groups involved in the queries), when (e.g., the periods where the queries are concerned), and how much data it purchases as privacy, and may want to keep the information conﬁdential from any others, including the data sellers and the broker. Aiello et al. [11] design a mechanism such that after making an initial deposit and maintaining a suﬃcient balance, a buyer can engage in an unlimited number of price-oblivious transfer protocols where the sellers and the broker cannot know anything
46

other than the amount of interaction and the initial deposit amount. The broker even cannot know the buyer’s current balance and when the buyer’s balance runs out. This is achieved by adapting conditional disclosure [83] to the two-party setting.
Distribution and use of private data are another important step where privacy may leak. Hynes et al. [107] demonstrate Sterling, a decentralized marketplace for private data, which supports privacy-preserving distribution and use of data. The central technical idea comes from privacy-preserving smart contracts on a permissionless blockchain. To provide strong security and privacy guarantees, they combine blockchain smart contracts, trusted execution environments and diﬀerential privacy. Particularly, smart contracts allow enforcement of constraints on data usage and enables payments and rewards.
5.6 Data Pricing in Novel Applications: Dynamic Data Pricing, Online Pricing and Federated Learning Pricing
The demand of data pricing arises in many novel application scenarios. In this subsection, we particularly discuss three emerging situations: dynamic data pricing, online pricing and pricing in federated learning.
Many applications are built on dynamic and online data. How to price temporal views on data streams properly is an important issue for practical data markets. One central task is to estimate and optimize the operational costs, which are the costs to evaluate queries of diﬀerent users on the ﬂy. The pricing decisions involve not only data sellers but also data buyers. For example, suppose two data buyers b1 and b2 purchase two queries q1 and q2, such that q2 can be written as a further selection on top of q1 (e.g., q1 is about all customers in North America, while q2 keeps all the same as q1 but focuses on only customers in Canada). The optimal pricing of q1 and q2 should take the advantage of the overlap between the two queries so that the sharing can save the operational costs, and, at the same time, be fair to b1 and b2.
Al-Kiswany et al. [12] propose a greedy method that enumerates all possible sharing plans and selects the one with the minimum additional cost. It does not come with any quality guarantee. Liu and Hacigu¨mu¨¸s [140] propose an improved method that takes some risk in sharing plan. If the
47

costs of the previous sharings are already cumulated to a high level, and the additional cost of a new sharing (i.e., the risk) is moderate and can be amortized well by the previous sharings, then the new sharing may be taken. They also give ﬁve rules to ensure fair pricing. Let AC(S) be the cost attributed to a sharing S. First, for two identical sharings S1 = S2, AC(S1) = AC(S2) should hold. Second, for any sharing S, AC(S) should be no higher than the lowest cost of S if no other sharing exists. Third, for two sharings S1 and S2, if the query of S1 is contained by the query of S2, that is, the result of S1 is a subset of the result of S2, and the lowest cost of S1 is smaller than the lowest cost of S2 if no other sharing exists, then AC(S1) ≤ AC(S2). Fourth, a sharing plan with common subexpressions with other sharings should be compensated. Last, the cost of the global plan should be equal to the sum of costs attributed to all sharings.
In order to purchase dynamic data, a buyer may have to call a seller’s API repeatedly. A buyer may have to pay for the same data multiple times. Upadhyaya et al. [195] explore how to modify APIs to achieve optimal history-aware pricing, that is, buyers are charged only once for data purchased and not updated. The central idea is the introduction of the notion of refund – a user can ask for refunds of data that she/he has bought before. For each query, the seller issues a coupon in addition to the query result, where the coupon records the identity information of the data in the query result. Speciﬁcally, a coupon c = ((id, uid, v), τ, H(id ⊕ τ ⊕ κ)), where id is a tuple identiﬁer, uid is a user-id, v is a version-id that is monotonically increasing, τ is a query identiﬁer that is also monotonically increasing, H is a cryptographic hash function [59], such as SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-3, and κ is a secret key only known to the seller. If a buyer gets two coupons c1 and c2 in two diﬀerent purchases such that c1[(tid, uid, v)] = c2[(tid, uid, v)], then the buyer can ask the seller for a refund by showing the two coupons. As pointed out by Deep and Koutris [55], the refund mechanism does not provide any arbitrage-free guarantee.
Qirana [55,56] can support history-aware pricing. To incorporate a query history, suppose a buyer already purchases queries Q = Q1, . . . , Qk and pays for a total of p(Q, D) so far. When a new query Qk+1 comes, let the support set Sk+1 = {Di ∈ S | Q(Di) = Q(D), Qk+1(Di) = Qk+1(D)}. Then, the new total price p((Q1, . . . , Qk, Qk+1), D) = p(Q, D) + Di∈Sk+1 wi. This history-aware pricing function is shown arbitrage-free.
48

Zheng et al. [223] consider online pricing for mobile crowd-sensing data markets. Diﬀerent from most of the work on data markets, they assume that data providers are distributed in space and there are three types of spatial queries from buyers, namely single-data query (e.g., inquiring the value at a speciﬁc location), multi-data query (e.g., inquiring the mean in a region) and range query (e.g., inquiring the probability that the data at a region falls in a given range). The vendor uses raw data from data providers and produces a statistical model through Gaussian process to answer queries. To form diﬀerent versions of data products, the vendor generates diﬀerent conditional Gaussian distribution with respect to locations and uses the conditional entropy to quantify the quality of the versions. They propose a randomized online pricing strategy so that the price can be adaptive from the historical queries. They show that the pricing mechanism is arbitragefree and is a constant factor approximation of revenue maximization.
Niu et al. [162] consider online data market where a query may be sold to diﬀerent buyers at diﬀerent time and the broker can adjust prices over time. The objective is to maximize the broker’s cumulative revenue by posting reasonable prices for sequential queries. They design a contextual dynamic pricing mechanism with the reserve price constraint. The central idea is to use the properties of ellipsoid for eﬃcient online optimization. Their method can support both linear and non-linear market value models with uncertainty.
Federated learning [146,147] trains a machine learning model across multiple decentralized parties, where each party holds local data without any peer-wise data exchanging. The parties and their data sets are often ordered in a federated learning process. To accommodate the participation order and value data in federated learning, Wang et al. [205] develop federated Shapley value. Let I be the set of participants and U be the utility function, where U(A + B) is the utility of training ﬁrst on A and then on B. For participant i at round t in a federated learning process, the federated Shapley value is

1

1

ψt(i) = |It| S⊆It\{i}

|It|−1 [U (I1:t−1 + S ∪ {i})) − U (I1:t−1 + S)]
|S|

if i ∈ It and ψt(i) = 0 otherwise. The federated Shapley value of a

party is the sum of the values of all rounds, that is, ψ(i) =

T t=1

ψt(i).

49

Wang et al. [205] show that the federated Shapley values have instantaneous group rationality, that is, i∈It ψt(i) = U (I1:t) − U (I1:t−1). The fairness is guaranteed at each round. That is, for any two parties i and j, ψt(i) = ψt(j) at round t if ∀S ⊆ It \ {i, j}, U (I1:t−1 + (S ∪ {i})) = U (I1:t−1 + (S ∪ {j})). Moreover, for any party i at round t, ψt(i) = 0 if ∀S ⊆ It \ {i}, ψ(I1:t−1 + (S ∪ {i})) = U (I1:t−1 + S). They also extend the previous Shapley value approximation techniques to compute federated Shapley values.
Sim et al. [186] consider the more general situation of collaborative machine learning and advocate using information gain as the utility function. For a model θ trained on data D, the information gain I(θ; D) = H(θ) − H(θ|D), which is the reduction in uncertainty. They generalize to ρ-Shapley fairness by assigning a reward ri = kψiρ to a party i. By tuning parameter ρ, they can trade oﬀ among Shapley fairness, individual rationality, stability of the grand coalition and group welfare.
Hu and Gong [105] consider privacy leaking in federated learning and design an incentive mechanism to compensate the cost of privacy leakage of the users that are most likely to provide reliable data. Their problem is formulated in a two-stage Stackelberg game [200]. Richardson et al. [176] use inﬂuence functions to reward data contributions to linear regression in the federated learning setting.
5.7 Summary
In this section, we review the topic of pricing data products. We ﬁrst analyze the structures, players, and ways to produce data products in data marketplaces. Then, we examine several important areas in pricing data products, including arbitrage-free pricing, revenue maximization pricing, fair and truthful pricing and privacy preserving pricing. We also discuss how to price dynamic data and online pricing. When pricing data products in a data marketplace, those several considerations are typically incorporated and integrated in one way or another.

6 Discussion and Open Challenges
Data pricing comes from practical demands and has been tackled in multiple disciplines. Although there is a rich body of literature addressing a series of issues in data pricing, there are still many questions remained unexplored. In this section, we discuss some interesting challenges for possible future work. By no means our list is exhaustive. Instead, we hope our discussion can intrigue more extensive interest and research eﬀort into this fast growing area.
6.1 Data Supply Chain: A Grand Challenge
At the macro level, although many studies focus on diﬀerent steps in data marketplaces, we clearly observe a lack of systematic investigation on data supply chains and development of end-to-end solutions. As data products are abundant and diversiﬁed, to develop ecologically sustainable marketplaces, supply chains of data products have to be built. Here, we introduce and advocate the notion of data supply chains, which connect all parties involved in data production and consumption, including data providers, data processors, data analysts, data product and services consumers and other possible roles. Each party in a data supply chain connects its upstream providers and its downstream consumers, provides its value-added contributions and obtains rewards. Feedback mechanisms through pricing and marketing have to be created in a data supply chain so that supply and consumption can be matched, coordinated and balanced. Most of those problems are not thoroughly thought about.
Although the notion of data supply chain is not mentioned in literature, some speciﬁc trends and challenges are discussed sporadically. For example, Muschalle et al. [151] identify some trends and challenges in data consumption and marketplaces. First, they assert that many essential data processing tasks are essential for data markets, such as labeling, annotating and aggregating data. Second, data markets will be integrated with numerous application domains. To enable domain data markets, it is important to customize general data processing technologies for niche domains. Third, customers want to have data faster. Thus, it is important to create online data query services and develop corresponding pricing models. Fourth, as there are more data, more data providers and more analysts, a data
51

product may be substituted by others. To hatch a healthy ecological data marketplace, it is important to establish standard data processing mashups to facilitate data product substitution. Fifth, to maintain a fair data market overall, it is important to provide price transparency so that data product providers have to optimize their data and data processing/analysis services. Last, customer preferences and experience are critical for data markets.
Recently, Acemoglu et al. [3] present an insightful study on the ecological eﬀect of data markets. They demonstrate that a user’s sharing of data may likely reveal some other users’ privacy and depress the price of other users’ data. The depressed prices lead to excessive data sharing and thus further reduce welfare. Their study suggests the need of mediation in data sharing in data markets.
Most recently, Fernandez et al. [71] analyze the challenges and propose a research agenda around constructing a data market platform to address the sharing, discovery and integration of data among many parties. Their big picture covers both market design and system development. The focus is to create the incentives and mechanisms to connect data supply and demand. As the middlemen, arbiters build data mashups to match data supply and demand. The market platforms advocated by the authors can be regarded as the data exchange mechanisms in data supply chain.
One challenge associated with the macro view of data supply chain is the interdisciplinary nature of data pricing research. As can be observed in this article, data pricing is studied in many diﬀerent disciplines, such as economics, marketing, electronic commerce, data management, data mining and machine learning. The communication and dialog among diﬀerent areas have to be strengthened.
6.2 Some Technical Challenges at the Micro Level
At the micro level, there are many research problems remained open. We name a few examples of fundamental problems.
First, most of the studies suggest relative prices of data products. Very few studies connect theoretical models with data pricing practice and investigate absolute prices of data products and their marketing eﬀect. As data pricing is a market mechanism and user behavior in practice is hard to modeled completely, experimental studies of data pricing models are essen-
52

tial and should be connected to theoretical investigations. Second, pricing is based on valuation and equilibrium among multiple
parties. Diﬀerent parties may have diﬀerent valuation on data, data products and data services. It is important to systematically establish the principles of value assessment for various parties in data marketplaces, such as data providers, data owners, data users, and data brokers. Moreover, it is important to understand what messages are passed to diﬀerent parties in data marketplaces through data pricing actions, and how. So far, value assessment of data and negotiations among diﬀerent parties in data marketplaces are largely not analyzed in detail.
Third, many pricing models are proposed in literature. It is important to understand how data pricing models and their assumptions can be implemented and enforced in practice. Speciﬁcally, accounting and auditing in data marketplaces are critical to achieve transparency in data pricing and eﬃciency in data marketplaces. Accounting and auditing in data marketplaces, however, are interesting problems that have not been investigated in depth yet. We need principles, quality guarantees and designs of operational procedures for accounting and auditing in data pricing, transactions and adversary detection.
Fourth, most of the studies on data pricing develop general models. At the same time, as data science transforms many application domains, data pricing has to deal with speciﬁc applications. Mechanisms, regulations and constraints in a speciﬁc domain may facilitate data pricing in some aspects, and post challenges in some other aspects. For example, Jia et al. [111] show that, although fair pricing in general is exponential in computation time but can be achieved polynomially in kNN models (Section 5.4). It is interesting and highly desirable to explore fairness, truthfulness, and privacy preservation of data pricing in speciﬁc applications.
Last but not least, almost all applications are dynamic in nature. The values of data, data products and data services may also evolve over time. The changes may be caused by the updates in demands and supplies. It is important to develop mechanisms to capture and monitor changes in demand and supply of data, data products and data services, and explore corresponding dynamic pricing.
